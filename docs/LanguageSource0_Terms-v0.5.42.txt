Background/&KS_GarradMilesBackground_Description	Text	An orphan from the streets of Caer Cyflen, Garrad survived thanks to a little luck and a lot of stubbornness.\nHe began as an apprentice cutpurse for the Thieves' Guild, but when he grew too big and too noticeable to melt into the crowds with a score, his masters decided that he would make a good crippled beggar.\n\nUnwilling to be maimed for the profit of others, he fled the Guild and the city by enlisting in the army.\nAfter a couple of years at a border fort near the Kingdom of Gallivan, Garrad hired himself out to merchants as a caravan guard, and spent time in several mercenary "free companies," raiding the Marches in the name of one noble or another. Based on his past experience, he dislikes thieves and their guilds, and shows no mercy to any underworld figures who cross him. \n\nAs the Principality began looking for adventurers, Garrad returned to answer the call. More than anything, he hopes that one dark night, in some quiet alley, he will meet the sadistic guildmaster who planned to maim him for profit.\n

Background/&KS_RhuadSwiftHandBackground_Description	Text	Rhuad always had a glib tongue and a swift hand, but one day he picked the wrong pocket. \nUnder the laws of the Principality he could have suffered a number of harsh punishments, but instead the mage who caught him red-handed - a fellow sylvan elf - sent him to the Treasurer's office for training.\n\nThus the Principality gained a swift, stealthy, and cunning spy whose greed is kept in check by the knowledge - and by regular reminders from his masters - that any transgression will lead to the swift and inevitable punishment for his original crime.\nRhuad remains a loyal agent of the Principality. He harbors a deep-seated hatred of the New Empire, where he began his life as a slave.

Background/&KS_VigdisKaikonnenBackground_Description	Text	Vigdis is the youngest daughter of Kaikkonen Vartija, the current head of the powerful Kaikkonen border clan in the Snow Alliance.\nSince girlhood she was known for her stubbornness and her strong sense of right and wrong. When she learned that her family planned to marry her into an allied clan for diplomatic reasons she left the Snow Alliance, one step ahead of a posse of brothers and cousins sent to recover her. \nReaching the Principality of Masgarth, she sought sanctuary at the great temple of Einar, refusing to leave despite all remonstrations. Her father, the Kaikkonen himself, traveled to the temple in an unprecedented attempt at reconciliation, but she refused to be persuaded into the political match. Instead, she entered her novitiate in the service of Einar.\nWhile her family did not formally disown her, it is generally considered unwise to mention her name in their presence. Surprising everyone but herself, Vigdis excelled during her novitiate: offered her choice of service as a reward, she chose to join the wandering Order of the Beacon. Since then she has traveled widely, bringing the light of Einar to all in need and fighting and bleeding for them when necessary.\nEven though she treats all as equals and never puts on airs, her accent and choice of words betray a noble background and a good education, as well as a certain familiarity in dealing with powerful people. Vigdis is a hardy dwarf and a true follower of Einar, and her lifestyle in the Order of the Beacon matches her temperament perfectly.\n

Background/&KS_VioletGoodCheerBackground_Description	Text	Violet is an unusual marsh halfling. Instead of staying safely at home in the reeds, her wanderlust has carried her far away, to the principality of Masgarth. \nTo make things worse, instead of following the good and sensible path of the marsh mage that originated among her people, she has chosen to become a showy, destructive shock arcanist! \nHer family is mortified. Some of their neighbors whisper that the Good-Cheers have a trace of wild island halfling blood, and have never been sensible… though they are careful never to do so when they can be overheard.\nViolet is an idealist, and believes that it is better to be out in the world seeing things and doing good, rather than sitting grumpily in a swamp. \nShe sees herself as the first of many Marsh Halfling heroes - well, mostly heroines, as she sees it - who will make the world a better place and win renown for themselves and their people. Her personal philosophy is based on freedom and personal accountability for one's actions. \n

Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content	Text	It has now been one week since we were transported to this wretched place! I think the gods have abandoned us! Of our monastery, the only building missing is the temple and its two resident priests! In its place, we have this weird construction, just out of reach of the pier, which we can't even enter. \n\nAll the survivors are scared. They are turning to me for comforting words, but I am only a novice, not yet ready to be a priest. Like them, I am a refugee who fled Sorr-Tarr and his vile servant.\n\nI do not know where we are, but we are far from home. Our little valley is a small pocket of Tirmar, lost - I don't know where!
Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content2	Text	Strange beasts roam the night, but for some reason they do not dare to enter our valley.\n\nI buried my daughter last night.

I reject the gods whose folly brought us here! I curse them all!\n\nThe beasts have grown bolder, but they still avoid our valley. A pity, since I could use the meat. I am surviving on grain and vegetables, but solitude makes for hard labor and my strength is not what it was.
Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content3	Text	It has been 40 years. I am the last one, an old man now! I buried them all - all! But I could not bring myself to give the last rites.

Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AdventurerJournal01_text1	Text	Aksha told me that if we wanted to meet the Master we would have to find the stairs and then follow a specific path.
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AdventurerJournal01_text2	Text	Once we find the stairs we need to go down, go up.

Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AdventurerJournal02_text2	Text	In the morning we will start again and this time we will follow the path to the maze's exit. I now am very sure the main stair in the middle of the maze is actually the way out.
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AdventurerJournal02_text3	Text	I was right! We followed the sign and it seems to work - we're getting closer to the main stair. Today we found two new symbols and… Wait! I don't think we're alone in the maze. I can hear them coming towards me. We will move away from that room and try to hide until…

Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_Description	Text	A locked book containing Aksha's notes since her arrival at the Keep.
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_text1	Text	Lizzaria sent another party of her stupid zombies. One of them was an ogre, as if that would make things harder. Reek and Filth took care of it - I didn't even have to walk out. When will she understand that her attempts are useless? I'm getting tired of pretending to ignore who sends these monsters. I'm also getting tired of Mardracht. The old elf is powerful, for sure, but his mind is in decay. While he barricades himself in his solar, I've read all his damn books, but learned almost nothing.
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_text2	Text	A Doom Gem. It took me forever to imbue it enough power to make it worthwhile. I still don't understand how the wizards of Manacalon could have done it in less than a year. Anyway, now I could use it to craft a nice weapon, but to what end? Killing Lizarria's zombies? I'm losing interest in the project now the difficult part is done. I don't need a magic dagger to make my enemies bleed.\n
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_text3	Text	Reek is a good minion. He used to be handsome, but undeath doesn't suit him. Now he's just an obedient little pawn. Who would guess he was once a nobleman? I kept his armor and shield - he doesn't need them any more. Filth was always scum, but now at least she is of some use. She brings corpses to feed the ghouls, so I don't have to walk through piles of rotting fools. I'm thinking of creating another Brood, though. A nice, meaty Brood of Flesh would be nice. Maybe next month.

Equipment/&CaerLem_Document_Inquisitor_Content	Text	My Dear Andrey,\nI have not had word of you since our desperate exodus to this dreadful world. My thoughts are with you, and I hope we will be reunited one day and live in peace at last.\nWe hoped for a friendly and peaceful world, far from the reach of the Enemy, but alas, we have found only fresh enemies, and our seers tell me that the Sorr-Akkath are not far behind. The war is not over, and we must also face these Manacalons.\nThey wield magic as potent as that of any priest, yet the High Priest assures us that there are no gods in this world.\nThese are dark times, and they will test us, but this world is our last hope.\nMay the Lord of Valor watch over you, my love.\nArtus

Equipment/&CaerLem_Document_MasterSmith_Content2	Text	I must confess, the wonders of Solasta's enchanters are awe-inspiring.\nThanks to Laerin, my new friend at the war foundry, I've learned how to prime weapons for enchantment. Of course, only Laerin has the magical knowledge to complete the… miracle. Arun pardon me for this word, but what this elvish magic can accomplish is simply god-like. \nAlas, our troops are massing to besiege the Rift and stop the enemy once and for all. I am ready for my first magical weapon, a gift for my Lady Karyn. She is already a formidable fighter, but with the blade Laerin will enchant, she will be even more so. \nI have collected various enchantments, and I am not sure yet which one will please her most.

Equipment/&HectorLetterContent1	Text	It was a bad plan; I said so from the start. It took me a month to master Griff's full appearance and a year to build the spider cult. The orcs are now loyal to me and eager to follow me to war, but the Scavengers have found the city and started encroaching on the orcs' territory. I decided to use the orcs ahead of schedule and wipe out the Scavengers. There were only a dozen of them, but they put up more of a fight than I expected, and I had to change the plan again. I sacrificed more orcs to capture their leader, a man named Hector. I will cancel the operation with the spider cult, and take the appearance of this Hector. A prominent member of the Scavengers could be useful. I must spend time alone with him deeper in the ruins, where the orcs don't go.
Equipment/&HectorLetterContent2	Text	I'm leaving this note in case the Tshar sends for me. I might not get out alive. I made a mistake going so deep, so near the amphitheater. The deep spiders are much more numerous than I thought, and they have killed my prisoner. I won't be able to become Hector. The mission is a complete failure and I will answer to the Tshar - if I survive. I will try to escape by climbing up the amphitheater, but the spiders might be too fast for me. Glory to Sorr-Tarr!

Faction/&ItemsScroll03_Title2	Text	A rolled, sealed letter in a leather case.
Faction/&ItemsScroll04_Description	Text	Tomaz,\n\nI do hope these words find you good health, and I am sorry for not writing sooner. Requisitioning the necessary supplies, and ensuring delivery is risky, and dangerous. But it is well worth it, as your letters have become a shining beacon of hope in the dark nights that haunt this prison.\n\nYour words of concern are not misplaced, as the wound of old is spreading my certain end through my feverish body. Days of labor are more torturous than the last, every disciplinary action leaving wounds that will never heal, and hunger has thinned the veil between reality and dream. I fear this letter may be my last.\n\nLong ago you asked me what crimes lead me here, and I professed my innocence. I could not risk that my beloved thought any less of me. Your worship of my fortitude, determination, and spirit allowed you to draw strength in dark times. I could not allow that to be tainted by my past. But now, in these final days, I understand that I was hardly worthy of that affection. I will never fathom how I deserved meeting you in this crucible of my own making.\n\nWhen I was young my mother's farm had fallen on hard times. I was sent to the Lady's estate to work as a maid amongst deranged aristocrats. These years were filled with mischievous pranks, brute discipline, and cruel indignities. All of my scars and faults tell of those years. The Lady never burdened herself with guilt, but put the blame solely on the shoulders of my mother. Repressed longings turned into despair, despair into resentment, and resentment into spite, which culminated into a hate-filled second of violence my mother did not survive.\n\nAnd despite my faults, lies, and my shameful past, you still loved me. I did not fully understand why until the end. You did not need to know my past, for your love is unconditional.\n\nPlease, my love, do not look at the past, but to the future. Do not fall for despair as I once did, but let the child birthed of our love carry you to a new beginning.\n\nMerilyn

Faction/&ItemsScroll04_Title2	Text	A letter, written in haste on a torn-out scrap of paper.
Faction/&ItemsScroll05_Description	Text	I, Nilocyrel Dream-Minder, hereby bear witness of the miracle of light.\n\nAs part of a conclave of mages focused on the research of magic and accompanied by the always interfering Imperial agents we were to investigate rumors of the sudden appearance of a seemingly magical construct of light deep in an uninhabited region of Aer-Elai. While fast-traveling through still civilized areas of the Empire, we took notice of strange rumors that had started to spread.\n\nSightings of creatures, burly as dwarves but almost as tall as the Sitherna itself. Clad in pelts and iron, aggressive and savage. At first we thought some children were exaggerating their encounter with the lonely remains of some scattered dwarves, but later on we were able to study a captive, while resting in a rural outpost. Its stature and surly look were comparable with the dwarves from the northern mountains, if it weren't for the obvious difference in size.\n\nJudging by the still wrinkle-free face it was most likely a youngling and seemed to be able to speak, but neither I nor my more traveled companions could make any sense of the guttural sounds it would utter. My colleague Andariel Silvertongue muses if it would be possible to use magic to understand these barbaric humanoids, but we didn't had time to further research this topic. Maybe our misguided brethren in the east might know more about this kin.\n\nFour days after we left the seat of the Arcaneum, while the darkness of the approaching night started to set in, we finally caught a glimpse of the incident we were tasked to research. I saw the sky burn with cold, otherworldly flames, which were of a kind neither of us had laid its eyes upon before.\n\nIt is too dark to continue and while a sight to behold, I sense a feeling of dread coming from this light. I entrust this interim report to an accompanying agent, who will travel back this night to report the coordinates this magical construct can be found at. Tomorrow we will advance further.

Faction/&ItemsScroll05_Title2	Text	A beautiful, illuminated manuscript.
Faction/&ItemsScroll06_Description	Text	His name was Thuriel Duskfall.\nA childhood disease left him deaf and disfigured.\nHe found his sole pleasure in life from fishing in the streams at night. Silent and at peace, he was not judged when alone and in the dark. Thus, he developed a skill that gave him value in the eyes of the sylvan elves, who otherwise viewed him as imperfect and damaged.\nHe was also my brother.\nI covered his body with a cairn of stones on the riverbank where I found it.\nThey had taken his rod and his fish, the bracelet he had from our father, his fileting knife, everything.\nSo I tracked them. They were many, and arrogant, but I had little else to do, and all the time in the world.\nFour died before they learned to leave guards at night.\nTwo more before they learned to make sure the guards were sober.\nSix of them slept together in a tent; I slit the throats of the three largest and left the rest to their sweet dreams.\nBy the time they made Port Harrow they were telling stories of the hordes of night witches who descended upon them from the haunted boughs of Colthannin, drinking the blood of their friends and depopulating entire villages.\nMore died there, where they mistakenly believed the crowds would give them safety.\nAn envoy from my people came, asking me to stop. I indicated that I would do so the day my brother came back to life.\nI have not done so.\nStranger, if you find this scroll, by the cairn by the river, I ask that you leave it be, and say a prayer for the soul of my brother.\nStranger, if you find this scroll, by the cairn by the river, and disturb the cairn, or take the scroll, know that I will find you.\nThey call me Nightplague.

Legal/&KickstarterDemoDisclaimerDescription	Text	IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: YOU are aware that what you intend to download and play is a very early PRE-ALPHA DEMO of the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game which is still under development. Be sure that OUR team is currently working hard to bring the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game to a whole new level. The PRE-ALPHA DEMO is made available for free for a limited period of time only. \n\nThe PRE-ALPHA DEMO is hand-crafted to give YOU an early taste of the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game; the PRE-ALPHA DEMO may contain bugs on rare occasions. YOU are more than welcome to share your feedback and report any problems or bugs on the Steam platform or directly on OUR website www.solasta-game.com. WE need to hear from YOU in order to make a game that is representative of what our community wants.\n\nSome rules and features are missing or are not implemented in the PRE-ALPHA DEMO. For example, the surprise round is not implemented, readying an action is not yet possible, we are too liberal at swapping inventory items, and some spells and effects are missing. We will fix this and try our best to integrate as much content and as many rules as possible for the final game. Some of the game features are also not demonstrated at all in the PRE-ALPHA DEMO but will be part of the final game: creating and leveling up a full party with a wide range of options, playing through a campaign storyline, and much more.

NPC/&NPC_IlastarKeenmindAirgetineDescription	Text	Ilastar is a member of the noble house Airgetine, whose forefathers were wizards of the Arcaneum. As with many Imperial families of that time, his family was originally a minor branch of the clan and began to rise to prominence after the Cataclysm, as it backed the first Emperor ("The Wailing Emperor") who took the rough decisions ultimately leading to the survival of Civilization and to the rise of the New Empire. More than anybody else of his generation, Ilastar is aware of what was lost and was a major proponent of participating to the Council, in the hope of gathering magical materials and writings expanding his knowledge of magic and thus giving the empire an edge in future conflicts. His main worry is that historical documents come to the fore, revealing some truths better left alone.

Tip/&LoadingTip01	Text	Casting spells consumes spell slots. Most classes regain spell slots after a long rest.
Tip/&LoadingTip02	Text	When rolling an attack or ability check with advantage, two d20s are rolled and the better result is used. When rolling with disadvantage, the worst result is kept.
Tip/&LoadingTip03	Text	Open the Journal screen ($Shortcut[PartyJournal]) to consult your party progress, objectives, and achievements.
Tip/&LoadingTip04	Text	You can customize your 3D dice in the Game Settings.
Tip/&LoadingTip05	Text	Spells consume spell slots when cast, unlike cantrips which can be cast at will.
Tip/&LoadingTip06	Text	Taking a long rest is the main way to recover all your spell slots, although wizards can use Arcane Recovery to recover a few low-level slots during short rests.
Tip/&LoadingTip07	Text	Most spellcasters cannot use all the spells they know. They need to prepare a number of them and take a long rest.
Tip/&LoadingTip08	Text	Wizards must learn new spells and write them in their spellbook before they can prepare and cast them.
Tip/&LoadingTip09	Text	Clerics and paladins always know all the spells they can cast at their level, but still need to prepare those they want to be able to cast.
Tip/&LoadingTip10	Text	Wizard spell scrolls are destroyed after casting. Wizards can also copy a spell from a scroll into their spellbook to acquire them, which also destroys the scroll.
Tip/&LoadingTip13	Text	Some creatures are afraid of light and can even be hurt by it, allowing you to use light as a weapon.
Tip/&LoadingTip14	Text	To perform a long rest, you must find a suitable place: either an inn such as the Gravekeep's Cask, or a campfire when exploring.
Tip/&LoadingTip15	Text	In each turn of battle, a character has a main action and a bonus action. The main action is used to move or attack, for instance, while bonus actions are granted by specific class features, spells, or powers.
Tip/&LoadingTip16	Text	Each player character can use a reaction once per turn. This allows them to interrupt someone else's action, for instance, to perform an opportunity attack.
Tip/&LoadingTip17	Text	Some characters or monsters can attack more than once per turn, and can move between attacks.
Tip/&LoadingTip18	Text	Shoving can push an enemy one cell away or put them down until they get up. Enemies can shove, too.
Tip/&LoadingTip19	Text	Dodging is a powerful defense even if it uses your main action: enemies have disadvantage on hitting you for the remainder of your turn.
Tip/&LoadingTip20	Text	Switch to cautious mode when exploring. You'll be slow, but better able to notice traps and footsteps.
Tip/&LoadingTip21	Text	In combat, you can move normally and then dash as your main action to go twice as far.
Tip/&LoadingTip22	Text	Most characters can jump two cells without a problem. Longer jumps require strength, and proficiency with Athletics helps a lot. You always have a chance to fall prone when landing if you jump far.
Tip/&LoadingTip23	Text	Most characters can climb two cells without a problem. Climbing higher requires strength, and proficiency with Athletics helps a lot. Some characters, like thieves or darkweavers, have superior climbing abilities.
Tip/&LoadingTip25	Text	After moving the camera around to examine your surroundings, you can center on a character and follow them. Either double-click the character's portrait or press TAB while controlling this character.
Tip/&LoadingTip26	Text	To better navigate in three dimensions, activate/deactivate the camera planar mode, with the button in the center of the compass (bottom right of the screen).
Tip/&LoadingTip27	Text	Flying spells or artifacts can let you move almost anywhere you want. But losing concentration means falling - possibly to your death.
Tip/&LoadingTip28	Text	When a battle starts, all creatures involved roll initiative to determine the play order. High dexterity raises your initiative.
Tip/&LoadingTip29	Text	Battles sometimes begin with one side being surprised. Surprised characters or creatures cannot act during the first round of battle.
Tip/&LoadingTip30	Text	You can set up weapon slots to change quickly from sword and shield to bow, for example, or to draw a torch along with a one-handed weapon. Prepare any combo you like.
Tip/&LoadingTip31	Text	Many consumables can be set up in the utility slot, making them available more quickly than the inventory would.
Tip/&LoadingTip32	Text	When you find a mysterious item, use Detect Magic first to determine whether it has magical properties. If it does, use Identify to learn how to use it.
Tip/&LoadingTip33	Text	Ingredients are various items like flowers, powders, and magic gems, allowing you to craft a variety of items, from healing potions to powerful magic swords.
Tip/&LoadingTip34	Text	To craft, you need the relevant proficiency. Your ability scores matter, too. For instance, to craft a scroll you need proficiency with the scroll kit, and Arcana will help a lot.
Tip/&LoadingTip35	Text	Crafting can be performed during downtime while traveling. A character with a crafting operation in progress works on their task before sleeping.
Tip/&LoadingTip36	Text	Personality flags influence the dialog lines spoken by a character. They don't make choices for you - they simply change the flavor of the experience.
Tip/&LoadingTip37	Text	When speaking to an NPC, the most suitable character in the party will automatically use Insight to guess which approach is most likely to work with them.
Tip/&LoadingTip38	Text	Your group has a specific level of relations with each of the game's factions. The more they like you, the more items they will sell you, and the lower their prices will be.
Tip/&LoadingTip39	Text	When bringing back items from the Badlands, choose which faction to sell them to. This will influence your relations with them.
Tip/&LoadingTip40	Text	Disengage can be used as a main action, allowing you to move outside the enemies' range without risking opportunity attacks.
Tip/&LoadingTip41	Text	When an enemy is in a neighboring cell, you are engaged. If you move away from that enemy, you risk suffering an opportunity attack.
Tip/&LoadingTip42	Text	Rogues can use sneak attack to increase their damage when they attack an enemy that is in a cell next to an ally, unless they have disadvantage on their attack roll.
Tip/&LoadingTip43	Text	Wielding two Light weapons allows you to perform a second attack with your bonus actions. Both weapons need the Light tag.
Tip/&LoadingTip44	Text	Wielding a finesse weapon allows you to use Dexterity as the main ability score for the attack, if it is better than Strength. Check for the Finesse tag.
Tip/&LoadingTip45	Text	A weapon with the Versatile tag can be used with one or two hands. If you leave the second hand slot empty, you'll deal more damage with such a weapon. Example: a longsword.
Tip/&LoadingTip47	Text	To level up, your characters need to take a long rest. They will gain their new power when waking up.

Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance_Description	Text	Excerpt from "The Vale of Remembrance to the Vale of Dreams"
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance01	Text	The Early Days of Coparann
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance02	Text	Excerpt from "The Vale of Remembrance to the Vale of Dreams"\nBy Kram Steelspine, Ceannard of the mines.
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance03	Text	We had heard rumors, and then most of the elven troops garrisoned in our Valley left through the Gates to meet a dire threat, yet with enough left behind to ensure that imperial law still reigned supreme! \nOn this direst of days, the sky broke, lightning fell again and again, and - worst of all - magic failed! I remember quite vividly the ashen face of our resident wizard, a young scion of a minor branch of House Airgetine, as he told Eldoril Sharp-Blade, the officer left in charge of the Vale, that mana had disappeared and that he wasn't even able to light a candle with his magic. 
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance04	Text	Eldoril Sharp-Blade, was a no-nonsense elven veteran who quickly realized that none of his contingency orders covered such an occurrence. Like every thrall, I was planning a rebellion against the imperial order. In the middle of the destruction wreaked by this Cataclysm, Eldoril made me realize that our fates were intertwined: Without magic, without the empire behind him, there was no way he would be able to compel us to behave like good little imperial thralls. On the other hand, some of his patrols had brought back the corpses of very dangerous-looking monsters, and his men had the equipment, discipline, and training needed to face such fearsome foes.   
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance05	Text	If only it had been that simple… The young Airgetine wizard thought himself the equal of a master in wit, if not in power, and managed to convince his personal guard to follow him on a trek towards the imperial heartlands, away from the taint of this travesty of discussion with thralls. As Eldoril didn't want to pitch his troops against fellow elves, he let them go, with a heavy heart. It was the last we heard or saw of them.
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance06	Text	One year after the Cataclysm, I met my first humans. Eldoril was able to tell me they were not, as I had thought, enemies but rather refugees turned allies of the Empire. And what a sorry bunch they were: some elderly, children, women, not many fighting men among them, and they were following an old man, Egil Karst, decked in clothes the color of fire. This first winter had been more than dire, but somehow, the steep walls of our valley had shielded us, and we had room left to shelter those people, provided they could forage for their own food. At that, Egil Karst, the cleric of Arun, gave a little smile and, out of nothing, conjured up a feast for his followers.
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance07	Text	We were all dumbstruck, magic was returning… And yet, our few remaining arcanists confirmed they could not sense mana. Egil confirmed this, explaining that he was only a vessel channeling the mana offered by the gods so that his flock could survive. Those human gods were real, and their magic was functioning. And those humans were all skilled with their hands, not being used to having magic at their disposal for every single task. Soon, they weren't refugees anymore but valued members of our community, helping mend and repair with their hands and stone and wood, instead of with spells and mana. 
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance08	Text	Their expertise was welcome as our foraging parties couldn't wander outside the fortress walls anymore, as the weather and the monsters had redoubled their assault. By now, even the fiercest of the anti-Manacalon among my miners approve of our tentative partnership with their erstwhile guards, as they have shown us that, no matter what their faults, their courage more than makes up for them. \nI am Kram Steel-Spine, the foreman of the mine, speaker to the elves, and Ceannard of the mines. Ceannard I remain, but of the whole Vale of Coparann, as we have chosen to rename our enclave. \nStrike true, fellow miners!
TutorialStep/&Crafting01Title	Text	Crafting
TutorialStep/&Crafting01Description	Text	In Solasta, you can craft various items. To do so, you need the proper equipment, ingredients, skill, and time. For magical items, sometimes you need to know spells.\n\nCrafting is performed while traveling, once your party has set up camp but is not yet sleeping.\n\nCharacters can devote some of their free time to working on their current crafting task.
TutorialStep/&Crafting02Title	Text	Crafting Equipment
TutorialStep/&Crafting02Description	Text	These are the tools required for crafting:\n\n-Potions: Herbalism kit\n-Scrolls: Scroll kit\n-Poisons: Poisoner's kit\n-Enchanted weapons and armor: Manacalon Rosary\n\nYou'll need to be proficient with these tools to use them.
TutorialStep/&Crafting03Title	Text	Crafting Skills
TutorialStep/&Crafting03Description	Text	Even if you're proficient with a given crafting tool, you'll still need specific skills to make successive checks against the recipe's DC.\nTo craft potions, sometimes Medicine is enough, but Arcana is very useful.\nTo craft poisons, Medicine or Nature is useful.\nTo craft scrolls or enchanted items, Arcana is a must. 
TutorialStep/&Crafting04Title	Text	Crafting Ingredients
TutorialStep/&Crafting04Description	Text	Crafting requires ingredients. They can be found while adventuring, gathered from flowers, bushes and rocks, sometimes from dead creatures. \nObviously, you can also buy them from shops, unless they are very rare.\nEnchanting requires Prime items that have been magically prepared for enchanting by Manacalon master smiths, whose secrets have been lost with the Cataclysm. Generally, a Primed Item will require a very rare additional ingredient to fulfill its potential.
TutorialStep/&Crafting05Title	Text	Crafting Recipes
TutorialStep/&Crafting05Description	Text	Finally, to craft an item, you need to know which ingredients to combine. These "recipes" can be learned by reading manuals or taught by masters. \nSolastan factions generally keep copies of recipes and sell them at good prices to their friends, but some can be found out there in the Badlands, too.\n\nOnce a recipe has been learned, all the party can use it.
TutorialStep/&Crafting06Title	Text	Crafting Interface
TutorialStep/&Crafting06Description	Text	To start crafting, open a character's screen and click on the Crafting tab. Simply select a recipe that is available to start.\nThe progress bar will fill as you travel, and you will be notified \nwhen the operation is over, so you can launch another one if you want.\nRemember that if you cancel a crafting operation, the ingredients are lost.

Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Description	Text	The Journal of Angbi Kramsson, of the Guild of Antiquarians.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content01	Text	If found, please return to the Guild of Antiquarians at Caer Cyflen. A reward will be offered.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content02	Text	Surroundings, continued …castle architecture is of First Expansion style, with many repairs and additions. A standard founding plaque: "Caer Tenarion", built by the 25th Iron Legion in the 24th year of Gwaltrian the Third - year 1557 in the Manacalon calendar, or 1486 before the Cataclysm. Presumably built to pacify the surrounding area.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content03	Text	Later, same day. My initial impression confirmed: the castle is occupied. I encountered a patrol of skeletons led by a wraith who gave his name as Adam the Twelfth, a former Imperial officer and now captain of the castle's guard. He questioned me closely and gave me permission to research outside the castle, but not to approach the castle or try to enter. The lord, whose name he gave as Mardracht, does not receive visitors. Indeed, the captain admitted that he himself had not seen or spoken with his master in several centuries.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content04	Text	Graveyard, continued …no gravestone shows a burial date later than the Cataclysm: no new burials in more than a thousand years. Possibly all in the castle are undead, like their guards. Impossible to confirm since I am refused admission.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content05	Text	Substantial mausoleum at far end of the cemetery, built in First Expansion style. Inscription over doorway names 25th Iron Legion. Presumably officers were buried inside (and possibly in catacombs beneath, if the building filled up over time) while lower ranks occupy the surrounding graveyard.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content06	Text	The following day, continued …as I continued to document the graveyard, a pack of wolves arrived from the north, led by a human man - or so he seemed. Met by captain and guards. Conversed for several minutes, manner guarded but not unfriendly. The captain pointed in my direction, clearly informing the man of my presence. No one in the group showed any interest in me.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content07	Text	Later, same day: An elven woman came out of the mausoleum, accompanied by several others: elves and humans, all apparently alive. They could not have entered the mausoleum without my seeing them. Two questions arise:
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content08	Text	Another way into the mausoleum? Possible catacombs beneath - underground passage into the castle?
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content09	Text	2. Living souls in the castle, yet no burials newer than 1,000 years? Two possibilities: life magically prolonged (necromancy? Fits with undead guard I encountered) and/or bodies not buried upon death (also compatible with necromancy).
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content10	Text	I watched from hiding as they explored the graveyard, apparently looking for something (me?). Extreme caution is indicated from now on.

Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content02	Text	For all I know she's told him I'm dead. She may be planning to make it true. He's so shaken and addled from the Cataclysm, he'd probably believe her. She could have killed him already - he could have been dead for centuries - but no: his magical defenses are still in place. He must be alive.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content03	Text	If only I could reach him - free him from her influence - but I can't get past her and her ghouls. So frustrating! I need to arrange a sudden meeting with a wooden stake, but she's careful.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content04	Text	Adam's no help. He won't join me against Aksha without orders from Mardracht, which of course can't come because she's got him isolated. How blind is he not to see that - I'll never yield the castle to her, no matter what she does. While Mardracht lives, I have to keep trying to save him.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content05	Text	…searching the graveyard as usual. The dwarf was there - he always thought I didn't see him, but I did - but now he's a ghost. Adam said he was an Antiquarian, some sort of scholar, so I tried to control him and find out what he knows.

Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Description	Text	Excerpt from "The Blood-Fang Invasion"\nBy Ceannard, 8th of his name.
Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Content01	Text	It all began as a series of raids, pinpricks outside our walls, attacks on caravans. Enough to worry us and elicit a response, but nothing more! Alas! it was a trick and the raids proved to be guided by a cunning hand able to predict our reactions with unerring accuracy.
Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Content02	Text	And so the force we sent after the raiders got wiped out, almost to the last man. It was more than a raid from an orcish clan; it was a full invasion aimed at conquering our vale! We were almost surprised at the gates, but managed to close them in time! We had lost our finest but our walls were strong and we were able to produce weapons to replenish our depleted arrows and bolt stocks quite fast. This siege gave us pause, as we didn't quite understand its purpose. The only access to the Vale of Coparann goes through the pass blocked by our town and the fortress. The vale itself is only easily accessible if you can fly! Otherwise, the steep walls provide as fine a natural defense as I have ever seen! 
Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Content03	Text	And yet, they were so numerous that our numbers began to slowly dwindle, and we started to realize that we wouldn't make it on our own! And so I sent for my childhood friend, Joris Nikannen, using magical and also more mundane messengers to relay our plight! 
Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Content04	Text	Two weeks later, the orcs managed to break through our defenses and reach the inner court! The hour was dire and all able to bear arms were manning hastily erected barricades, as it was only a matter of time till the phalanx at the gate was worn down! And it was in that instance that Gromnir Stonefist and his mercenaries hit the enemy's rear! Fierce was his assault, but cunning too. A series of hit-and-run strikes from many directions, fireballs and lightning bolts exploding, and coming from what seemed like a thousand voices, war cries from known units of the Principality of Masgarth! The orcs thought the rescuers far more numerous than they were, and Captain Stonefist managed to strike hardest at the command group of the orcs, killing the blood shaman who was keeping the clans together. It broke their spirit! We had won, but the cost was great and the feeling in my mouth was mixed! Joris Nikannen saw it and found the words to shake me out of my gloom! 
Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Content05	Text	"Ceannard, you think its grim, and it is! But believe me, being on the losing side would be even worse, as the orcs would have slaughtered or enslaved us all, down to the last babes!"\nCeannard the 8th - Chronicle of the Blood-Fang invasion

Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Title	Text	On the New Magic of Humans and Their Gods
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Description	Text	An ancient-looking book, with the eight rings of the Arcaneum embossed into the cover. 
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content01	Text	On the New Magic of Humans and Their Gods, and Its Particular Implications for Necromancy. By Alithariel Threanin, Postulant Junior Master of the Arcaneum, School of Necromancy. Academic Session of 3044, Imperial Calendar
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content02	Text	As my thesis in support of my candidacy for the rank of Junior Master of the Arcaneum at the School of Necromancy, I respectfully submit the results of my research into the nature and types of new magics brought to Solasta by the humans of Tirmar, in particular the effectiveness of those whom they call "clerics" in repelling and destroying undead creatures. This knowledge is of urgent importance as we struggle to understand these humans, and assess both the severity of the threat they may post to the Empire and the potential benefit they could bring to it once conquered.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content03	Text	It is widely known that the magic of humans derives from the entities they call "gods" ("goddesses" in the feminine, and "deities" collectively). I call it "divine magic" in this thesis, to distinguish it from our own arcane magic that is the result of magical study. Just as arcane magic is organized into schools, some divine magic is comprised of eight areas of study, which the humans call "domains." Each deity typically provides its clerics with access to two domains, representing its particular interests. The domain that corresponds most closely to the School of Necromancy is called the Domain of Oblivion.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content04	Text	In addition to spells from two domains, a cleric has access to a wide array of other spells and powers, which are common to all regardless of their patron deity. Many are broadly similar in their effects to the spells of the School of Necromancy. There are two necromantic powers, though, that are completely new and unique: a cleric of any Tirmarian deity, if their rank is high enough, can repel undead creatures and even destroy them. The humans I have questioned believe that this is because their deities regard all undead creatures as "unnatural" - a word that reveals much about their primitive level of sophistication - and therefore undesirable, but they seem to know nothing about the means by which this result is achieved, speaking only about the "will" or "power" of their deities.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content05	Text	The following pages examine the phenomenon of "turning" and destroying undead using both the classical thaumatological approach of Fathirien and her successors, and the more modern methods championed by Gorlindrien and the Practicalists. All conclusions are tentative. If this thesis is accepted, I propose to make this phenomenon my primary research topic.

Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Description	Text	A page apparently torn from a book, crumpled and thrown on the floor.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Content01	Text	…as the Soraks followed humanity, a high priest of Oblivion succumbed to despair and madness. He tainted the peace of the grave with the uncleanliness of undeath, raising the fallen to muster an army. As he knew this was not a prayer that would gain the favor of Maraike, the lady of life and death, he and his followers couched their plan in the form of a curse instead, tricking their goddess into ensuring that their plan would succeed. Maraike granted their plea, but was not deceived. She cursed the conspirators as well, for they had been corrupted by evil and were denied her grace. They became the fallen, and those they raised from death became sorrow zombies, named after the curse of sorrow that they had wrought.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Content02	Text	Maraike's punishment ensured that none of the fallen could enjoy the touch of light without suffering and dying. They must forever skulk in the shadows until they repented. But Maraike's punishment was not all. Sorr-Tarr, the vile god of the Soraks, saw potential in the fallen. Without undoing Maraike's curse, he gave them powers to do evil: to corrupt others by their touch, and to create fouler servants than zombies. Of the original fallen not much is known, save that there were twelve of them, priests and paladins…

Equipment/&Necromancy_Refugees_Content01	Text	…the humans explained that they had fled to Solasta from their home, a world they called Tirmar, and that they were pursued by a race they called Sorr-Akkath or Soraks, which had spread across this world of Tirmar, and threatened to conquer all others.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Refugees_Content02	Text	The Governor received them with the appearance of kindness, reasoning that if they came as supplicant fugitives it would be an easy task to subdue them, and either set them to work as slaves alongside the inferior races of Solasta or bind them over to the wizards of the Arcaneum for dissection or whatever other form of study might prove most fruitful. When the guards sought to bind the humans, though, they called upon beings they called "gods," and manifested powerful magics that took their hosts by surprise. Thus they were able to escape.

Equipment/&Necromancy_Gods_Description	Text	A page apparently torn from a book, crumpled and thrown on the floor.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Gods_Content01	Text	…deities of Tirmar are a source of a new and unknown kind of magic. The humans believe they are powerful entities, perhaps extraplanar in nature, whom they worship and whose commands they follow, receiving power in return.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Gods_Content02	Text	The humans are careful to distinguish between "good" and "evil" deities. "Good" deities are those whom the humans see as helpful to them, and - in their theology at least - concerned with their welfare. "Evil" deities are those who are hostile to humans and support the efforts of other races to conquer them. It was an "evil" deity and his followers - one Sorr-Tarr and the race of the Sorr-Akkath, or Soraks - who drove the humans to try to escape their home world of Tirmar, they say. Their arrival on Solasta…

Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Description	Text	An old book with the image of a dragon embossed on the cover.
Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Content01	Text	There was a time, very long ago, when dragons were the rulers of Solasta. They lived in the mountains, close to volcanoes which they loved for their heat - for nothing else was hot enough to incubate a dragon's egg. At that time the dwarves had not yet come up from below ground, being more rock than flesh, and the halflings remained in their swamps, far from anyone. And what of the elves? The elves were in and of the air, without physical form but existing as swirling currents of air and mana, one with magic and with the world.
Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Content02	Text	Eventually, however, the elves tired of a life of pure spirit and wind. They took a physical form and began to build great spires and palaces, bringing the beauty of their thoughts into material being. The dragons feared them, and a great war ensued, pitting fire and magic against air and magic until the elves…

Equipment/&Abjuration_Housekeeping_Description	Text	An old book that seems to have been well-thumbed.
Equipment/&Abjuration_Housekeeping_Content01	Text	The supreme duty of the head of a household is the management of servants. This is more important even than the welfare of the family, because a household can survive internal strife and injustice, but it cannot survive a breakdown in discipline. Heed well the lessons of history, and keep thoughts of revolt from the minds of your slaves.
Equipment/&Abjuration_Housekeeping_Content02	Text	Remember that no matter how intelligent and endearing they may seem, your non-elf slaves are animals, nothing more. Do not indulge them, but give them every day a new reason to fear your wrath and a fresh reminder that your power is absolute. It is not going too far, if you can afford it, to select one at random now and again for death by torture. As well as providing entertainment for your guests and an example for your children, this practice instils a healthy…

Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Description	Text	An ancient book.
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content01	Text	The dragons saw how the elves were changing the world, bringing beauty to blasted volcanic wastes, and living green to barren fields of rock. They had never seen beauty before, nor heard music; their language was devoid of poetry, and their magic was brutal and without wonder.
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content02	Text	The dragons fell in love with the elves, as all do who see them. They longed to possess them, for dragons are avaricious by nature. With sweet words and trickery they enslaved a few of the fair people, but most elves were not taken in by the dragons' flattery, and prepared to resist them.
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content03	Text	Great battles were fought, blade against flame, and magic against magic. Mountains were leveled, and land sank to make the Inner Sea. The tunnels where the dwarves hid in fear were flooded. It was in that bloody crucible that our people's mastery of magic was forged, and the elven race united under the first Emperor Ilmathir Ellanion.

Equipment/&Illusion_Book1_Description	Text	A book written in high elvish.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book1_Content01	Text	…as Master Irillien of the Arcaneum wrote in his great work "On the Nature of Illusion and the Question of Reality," "Many illusions, if believed, are as effective as if they were real; conversely, some realities, if ignored, may be avoided. Which, then, is more valid? What, indeed, is real, or reality? Was our great Empire, and our rightful mastery of the world and all who dwell therein, not a dream, which is a form of illusion, before our Iron Legions and our arcanists made it real?"
Equipment/&Illusion_Book1_Content02	Text	There is some merit, therefore, in avoiding a distinction between illusion and reality, but regarding them instead as two poles of a continuum. Some things are entirely real, and some things are entirely illusory, but the numbers of each are far fewer than is commonly supposed. Most things lie somewhere in between, partaking of the natures of illusion and reality in differing proportions. Those who seek a true understanding of the nature of things, and the distinctions…

Equipment/&Illusion_Book2_Content01	Text	…exploration of the planes outside our own revealed the existence of all manner of strange entities, some of them exceptionally powerful. It is to be supposed that the world of Tirmar, from which the humans came with their gods, belongs in one of these planes, which somehow collided with our own during the events leading up to the Cataclysm, instead of remaining safely confined beyond a magical portal.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book2_Content02	Text	The reason for this is unknown. Several theories have been put forward, but none has been proven. Although they vary in their finer details, many theories blame the deity Sorr-Tarr, from whom the humans and their gods were fleeing as they entered Solasta. The scholars of the Arcaneum do not fully understand the class of beings called "gods" or "deities," and while their human followers proudly assert that their powers are without limit, it is clear that this cannot be the case, or the Cataclysm would have been prevented. Still, this Sorr-Tarr, being a powerful entity of this class, might have sought to open the Rift wider, in order to facilitate the pursuit by his Sorr-Akkath followers and complete…

Equipment/&Illusion_Book3_Description	Text	A book written in high elvish.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book3_Content01	Text	…humans and Sorr-Akkath are thought to be the only mortal beings to cross from Tirmar, the question of orcs and their kin must be taken into account. Human accounts of the matter are confused and often contradict each other, but a careful reading of the best sources suggests that the orcs were once human, and were altered by the wild magics that accompanied the closing of the Rift.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book3_Content02	Text	The human ancestors of the orcs were members of wild barbarian tribes from the more remote parts of Tirmar. Ferocity and courage in battle were the highest values in their culture, so when the forces of our two worlds combined at the Battle of the Rift, it was these tribes who sought out the most dangerous locations in order to win the most glory by the values of their culture. This brought them very close to the Rift itself, and therefore made them most vulnerable to the unpredictable magical energies that flared out from it. All of those who fought beside them perished, even the elite of the Iron Legions - but somehow these barbarians, strong of mind and strong of body, were able to survive. However, their bodies and minds were both affected, and they became the first orcs to exist in both worlds.

Legal/&EarlyAccessDisclaimerDescription	Text	Hey there folks! Welcome to Solasta - or more specifically, the Early Access of Solasta: Crown of the Magister. We really appreciate your support. You're all fantastic!\n\nPlease bear in mind that you are playing an Early Access version of Solasta: Crown of the Magister which is still under development. This Early Access version contains around 10 hours of gameplay and gives you access to the full Character Creation Tool with all ancestries, classes, and archetypes unlocked, with a maximum level cap at level 6. The full 1.0 release will see a price increase and will deliver the entire main campaign of Solasta: Crown of the Magister, as well as many side quests for you to discover. \n\nWe have done our best to provide a strong and enjoyable experience. However, do note that the Early Access version may contain some occasional bugs. You are warmly invited to send us feedback, report any bugs and problems, or suggest improvements on our Discord server (https://discord.com/invite/uu8utaF) as well on our official forums (https://forums.solasta-game.com/). Our goal is to continue working hand in hand with our players to make a game that is representative of what our community wants. Be sure that our team is currently working hard to release the full version of the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game that will include lots of additional features and content. \n\nConsidering the fact that game development is a very iterative process, please understand that your save files on the Early Access version will likely be incompatible with larger updates and with the full game release. As such, if you are looking for the complete experience the full version of Solasta: Crown of the Magister can offer, we encourage you not to purchase this Early Access version, but to wait for the release of the full game. Alright, enough reading - go and enjoy the game!

That was the start of it all. Soon, all eyes turned to the Badlands. The thirst for the forgotten secrets of the Old Empire was growing.\n\nThe rest is scribbled.

PartyBanter/&Serious2_Trap_Trigerred_Self	Text	Damn it!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Trap_Trigerred_Self	Text	I hate those!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Trap_Disarmed_Self	Text	Easy.
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Trap_Disarmed_Self	Text	Piece of junk.
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Trap_Disarmed_Self	Text	Done and done.
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Light_up_Self	Text	I needed that.
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Light_up_Self	Text	Light, at last.
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Light_up_Self	Text	Light, my friend.
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Break_Stealth_Self	Text	Damn!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Break_Stealth_Self	Text	No!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Break_Stealth_Self	Text	Clumsy idiot!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Critical_Hit_Given_Self	Text	Bleed!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Critical_Hit_Given_Self	Text	Die!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Critical_Hit_Given_Self	Text	You like that?
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Normal_Hit_Given_Self	Text	Take that!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Normal_Hit_Given_Self	Text	Wait till the next one!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Normal_Hit_Given_Self	Text	More coming your way.
PartyBanter/&Serious4_Normal_Hit_Given_Self	Text	You'll die like the rest!
PartyBanter/&Serious5_Normal_Hit_Given_Self	Text	No quarter given!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Missed_Attack_Self	Text	Damn!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Missed_Attack_Self	Text	No!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Missed_Attack_Self	Text	Come on!
PartyBanter/&Serious4_Missed_Attack_Self	Text	I won't miss next time!
PartyBanter/&Serious5_Missed_Attack_Self	Text	You'll die anyway!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Kill_Enemy_Self	Text	I win again.
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Kill_Enemy_Self	Text	You lose.
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Kill_Enemy_Self	Text	Go to hell!
PartyBanter/&Serious4_Kill_Enemy_Self	Text	You're not coming back.
PartyBanter/&Serious5_Kill_Enemy_Self	Text	You didn't get me.
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Healed_by_ally_Self	Text	Thanks.
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Healed_by_ally_Self	Text	I'll remember.
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Healed_by_ally_Self	Text	I owe you one.
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Allied_KnockedDown_Self	Text	Come on! 
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Allied_KnockedDown_Self	Text	Don't let me down!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Allied_KnockedDown_Self	Text	No!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Trap_Trigerred_Other	Text	What an idiot!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Trap_Trigerred_Other	Text	Open your damn eyes!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Trap_Trigerred_Other	Text	Pay attention!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Trap_Disarmed_Other	Text	Well done!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Trap_Disarmed_Other	Text	One less problem.
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Trap_Disarmed_Other	Text	I hate those!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Long_Jump_Other	Text	That was something!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Long_Jump_Other	Text	Nice jump!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Long_Jump_Other	Text	Well done!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_High_Climb_Other	Text	Good arms you got!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_High_Climb_Other	Text	Didn't think you could do it!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_High_Climb_Other	Text	Okay, you're tough.
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Break_Stealth_Other	Text	Clumsy!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Break_Stealth_Other	Text	I don't believe it!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Break_Stealth_Other	Text	You'll get us all killed!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Pushing_Heavy_Other	Text	Come on, harder!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Pushing_Heavy_Other	Text	Push!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Crawling_Other	Text	Dive in the dirt, now.
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Crawling_Other	Text	Crawling through dirt - nothing new here.
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Critical_Hit_Received_Other	Text	You'll get a nice scar!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Critical_Hit_Received_Other	Text	If it doesn't kill you…
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Normal_Hit_Received_Other	Text	Walk it off!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Normal_Hit_Received_Other	Text	Deal with it!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Critical_Hit_Given_Other	Text	That's the way!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Critical_Hit_Given_Other	Text	Kill 'em all!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Critical_Hit_Given_Other	Text	Crush 'em!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Normal_Hit_Given_Other	Text	Again! Harder!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Normal_Hit_Given_Other	Text	More!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Normal_Hit_Given_Other	Text	That's battle!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Missed_Attack_Other	Text	You suck!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Missed_Attack_Other	Text	Stop that!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Missed_Attack_Other	Text	I thought you could fight!
PartyBanter/&Serious1_Kill_Enemy_Other	Text	That, I like!
PartyBanter/&Serious2_Kill_Enemy_Other	Text	Keep 'em coming!
PartyBanter/&Serious3_Kill_Enemy_Other	Text	Good kill!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Trap_Detected_Self	Text	Hold it - I see a trap!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Trap_Detected_Self	Text	Everybody freeze!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Trap_Detected_Self	Text	Wait! I see a trap.
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Secret_door_Detected_Self	Text	Friends! There's a hidden door here!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Secret_door_Detected_Self	Text	Look at that - a secret door!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Secret_door_Detected_Self	Text	Thought I'd miss you, eh?
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Trap_Trigerred_Self	Text	No!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Trap_Trigerred_Self	Text	Sorry for that!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Trap_Trigerred_Self	Text	I'm such an idiot!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Trap_Disarmed_Self	Text	That wasn't so bad.
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Trap_Disarmed_Self	Text	I think I did it.
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Trap_Disarmed_Self	Text	Mission accomplished.
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Light_up_Self	Text	The Light is with us.
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Light_up_Self	Text	The Light will guide us.
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Light_up_Self	Text	We bring light in darkness!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Break_Stealth_Self	Text	Oops!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Break_Stealth_Self	Text	Sorry!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Break_Stealth_Self	Text	I know, I know!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Critical_Hit_Given_Self	Text	Surrender or die!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Critical_Hit_Given_Self	Text	I take no prisoners!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Critical_Hit_Given_Self	Text	I will kill you.
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Normal_Hit_Given_Self	Text	Bend the knee or perish!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Normal_Hit_Given_Self	Text	Run while you can!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Normal_Hit_Given_Self	Text	You can't win!
PartyBanter/&Heroic4_Normal_Hit_Given_Self	Text	I am unbeatable!
PartyBanter/&Heroic5_Normal_Hit_Given_Self	Text	You cannot defeat me!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Missed_Attack_Self	Text	Damn!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Missed_Attack_Self	Text	Come on!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Missed_Attack_Self	Text	I must do better!
PartyBanter/&Heroic4_Missed_Attack_Self	Text	I'm getting the measure of this!
PartyBanter/&Heroic5_Missed_Attack_Self	Text	Next time!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Kill_Enemy_Self	Text	Once more, we prevail!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Kill_Enemy_Self	Text	Another victory! This is destiny!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Kill_Enemy_Self	Text	You were doomed.
PartyBanter/&Heroic4_Kill_Enemy_Self	Text	You should have fled.
PartyBanter/&Heroic5_Kill_Enemy_Self	Text	You should have yielded.
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Healed_by_ally_Self	Text	I'm in your debt, my friend.
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Healed_by_ally_Self	Text	I will not forget this.
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Healed_by_ally_Self	Text	I owe you my life.
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Allied_KnockedDown_Self	Text	Hold on to life, friend!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Allied_KnockedDown_Self	Text	We won't let you die!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Allied_KnockedDown_Self	Text	We leave no one behind!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Trap_Trigerred_Other	Text	Closer attention required, friend!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Trap_Trigerred_Other	Text	You're lacking focus.
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Trap_Trigerred_Other	Text	A little bit of caution here, please?
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Trap_Disarmed_Other	Text	Good work!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Trap_Disarmed_Other	Text	Well done, friend!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Trap_Disarmed_Other	Text	Your skills are impressive!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Long_Jump_Other	Text	What a fantastic leap!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Long_Jump_Other	Text	You have trained well!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Long_Jump_Other	Text	I'm impressed!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_High_Climb_Other	Text	That's impressive.
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_High_Climb_Other	Text	You're impressively fit.
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_High_Climb_Other	Text	I underestimated you. My apologies!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Break_Stealth_Other	Text	That wasn't smart.
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Break_Stealth_Other	Text	You'll need to do better than that!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Break_Stealth_Other	Text	More caution next time!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Pushing_Heavy_Other	Text	With all your might!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Pushing_Heavy_Other	Text	You can do it!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Crawling_Other	Text	Sometimes there is simply no choice.
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Crawling_Other	Text	I don't like it either.
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Critical_Hit_Received_Other	Text	Courage!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Critical_Hit_Received_Other	Text	You're still standing!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Normal_Hit_Received_Other	Text	You can take it!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Normal_Hit_Received_Other	Text	Shake it off!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Critical_Hit_Given_Other	Text	That's the way!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Critical_Hit_Given_Other	Text	Masterful!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Critical_Hit_Given_Other	Text	You'll surely prevail!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Normal_Hit_Given_Other	Text	Well struck!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Normal_Hit_Given_Other	Text	Perfect!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Normal_Hit_Given_Other	Text	Go on!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Missed_Attack_Other	Text	Better luck next time!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Missed_Attack_Other	Text	Don't lose hope!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Missed_Attack_Other	Text	Just bad luck!
PartyBanter/&Heroic1_Kill_Enemy_Other	Text	Victory is yours!
PartyBanter/&Heroic2_Kill_Enemy_Other	Text	Impressive move, my friend!
PartyBanter/&Heroic3_Kill_Enemy_Other	Text	Nobody has your skills, bravo!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Trap_Detected_Self	Text	A crude trap.
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Trap_Detected_Self	Text	We won't be fooled so easily.
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Trap_Detected_Self	Text	I spotted a trap of sorts.
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Secret_door_Detected_Self	Text	I believe there is a hidden door.
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Secret_door_Detected_Self	Text	This has to be a secret passage.
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Secret_door_Detected_Self	Text	Interesting - a secret door.
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Trap_Trigerred_Self	Text	How foolish of me!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Trap_Trigerred_Self	Text	How could I miss it?
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Trap_Trigerred_Self	Text	I really must be more careful.
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Trap_Disarmed_Self	Text	That was simplicity itself!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Trap_Disarmed_Self	Text	Not as taxing as I expected.
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Trap_Disarmed_Self	Text	Ingenious, but not unbeatable.
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Light_up_Self	Text	A little light is always welcome.
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Light_up_Self	Text	Let there be light!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Light_up_Self	Text	Blessed are the Lightbringers!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Break_Stealth_Self	Text	Curses! My fault.
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Break_Stealth_Self	Text	I really thought I… never mind.
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Break_Stealth_Self	Text	How tiresome.
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Critical_Hit_Given_Self	Text	Hah! Take that, you fiend!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Critical_Hit_Given_Self	Text	Just where it hurts most!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Critical_Hit_Given_Self	Text	Death reaches out for you!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Normal_Hit_Given_Self	Text	Not bad, eh?
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Normal_Hit_Given_Self	Text	A modest success!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Normal_Hit_Given_Self	Text	A palpable hit!
PartyBanter/&Formal4_Normal_Hit_Given_Self	Text	Lucky? Perhaps.
PartyBanter/&Formal5_Normal_Hit_Given_Self	Text	I trained hard for this!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Missed_Attack_Self	Text	Fortune is fickle!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Missed_Attack_Self	Text	Most unfortunate, that.
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Missed_Attack_Self	Text	Only the last blow matters!
PartyBanter/&Formal4_Missed_Attack_Self	Text	Next time, I swear…
PartyBanter/&Formal5_Missed_Attack_Self	Text	I'll get you yet!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Kill_Enemy_Self	Text	One foe down!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Kill_Enemy_Self	Text	Death claims you!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Kill_Enemy_Self	Text	Victory is mine!
PartyBanter/&Formal4_Kill_Enemy_Self	Text	A victory fit for a song!
PartyBanter/&Formal5_Kill_Enemy_Self	Text	Another victory!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Healed_by_ally_Self	Text	You are a true savior.
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Healed_by_ally_Self	Text	You are a valued comrade.
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Healed_by_ally_Self	Text	I am in your debt, my friend.
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Allied_KnockedDown_Self	Text	The fight is not yet over!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Allied_KnockedDown_Self	Text	Your comrades will save you!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Allied_KnockedDown_Self	Text	We are coming!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Trap_Trigerred_Other	Text	Tsk. An elementary mistake.
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Trap_Trigerred_Other	Text	Watch your step, friend!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Trap_Trigerred_Other	Text	A dangerous error.
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Trap_Disarmed_Other	Text	Perfectly executed!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Trap_Disarmed_Other	Text	My congratulations on a job well done.
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Trap_Disarmed_Other	Text	Your skill is impressive.
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Long_Jump_Other	Text	An extraordinary jump!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Long_Jump_Other	Text	Most impressive!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Long_Jump_Other	Text	Such athleticism!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_High_Climb_Other	Text	What strength!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_High_Climb_Other	Text	It seems effortless!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_High_Climb_Other	Text	Clearly you have trained well.
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Break_Stealth_Other	Text	Even the dead could hear you!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Break_Stealth_Other	Text	Of course you've been detected!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Break_Stealth_Other	Text	Perhaps if you tried to be loud, instead?
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Pushing_Heavy_Other	Text	You can do it!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Pushing_Heavy_Other	Text	Heave, now - all your strength!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Crawling_Other	Text	Undignified, but necessary.
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Crawling_Other	Text	Kneel now, rise later.
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Critical_Hit_Received_Other	Text	Are you still with us?
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Critical_Hit_Received_Other	Text	That was a lucky hit!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Normal_Hit_Received_Other	Text	Hold firm - you've endured worse!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Normal_Hit_Received_Other	Text	You're still in the fight, my friend!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Critical_Hit_Given_Other	Text	A telling blow!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Critical_Hit_Given_Other	Text	A fine stroke!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Critical_Hit_Given_Other	Text	Truly formidable!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Normal_Hit_Given_Other	Text	Well struck!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Normal_Hit_Given_Other	Text	Well done!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Normal_Hit_Given_Other	Text	You have them now!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Missed_Attack_Other	Text	Oh! Bad luck!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Missed_Attack_Other	Text	Next time!
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Missed_Attack_Other	Text	Try again!
PartyBanter/&Formal1_Kill_Enemy_Other	Text	Bravo! Victory is yours!
PartyBanter/&Formal2_Kill_Enemy_Other	Text	A good kill, as they say.
PartyBanter/&Formal3_Kill_Enemy_Other	Text	One less enemy!
Narration/&LoreTrailer01	Text	Before the Cataclysm, there were no Gods on Solasta.
Narration/&LoreTrailer02	Text	No humans, either.
Narration/&LoreTrailer03	Text	Then the rift opened.
Narration/&LoreTrailer04	Text	Some say it was a magical accident... 
Narration/&LoreTrailer05	Text	...or the work of an evil god.
Narration/&LoreTrailer06	Text	No one knows for sure.
Narration/&LoreTrailer07	Text	The Cataclysm destroyed the old High Elf empire
Narration/&LoreTrailer08	Text	- Manacalon, they called it -
Narration/&LoreTrailer09	Text	and twisted the land beyond recognition.
Narration/&LoreTrailer10	Text	Now, only the brave and the foolish go there, in search of ancient treasures.
Narration/&LoreTrailer11	Text	But something is happening, deep in those Badlands.
Narration/&LoreTrailer12	Text	Whatever it is,
Narration/&LoreTrailer13	Text	it can't be good.
Narration/&TelemaArrivingTitle	Text	Entering Telema
Narration/&Telema_1_Entrance_Fighter	Text	So these are the ruins of Telema?
Narration/&Telema_2_Entrance_Wizard	Text	Just as the chronicles describe them!
Narration/&Telema_3_Entrance_Wizard	Text	Imagine the wonders that await us inside!
Narration/&Telema_4_Entrance_Cleric	Text	Don't forget... we're here to help the Scavengers.
Narration/&Telema_5_Entrance_Rogue	Text	And get rich, right?
Narration/&Telema_6_Entrance_Rogue	Text	Help the Scavengers and get rich.
Narration/&Telema_7_Entrance_Fighter	Text	You're all heart, aren't you?
Narration/&Telema_8_Entrance_Cleric	Text	That must be their camp over there.
Narration/&Telema_9_Entrance_Cleric	Text	Come on, let's go.
Narration/&TelemaMeetingScavsTitle	Text	The Scavengers Camp
Narration/&Telema_10_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	Who goes there?
Narration/&Telema_11_MeetingScavs_Fighter	Text	Friends!
Narration/&Telema_12_MeetingScavs_Cleric	Text	Runnel sent us.
Narration/&Telema_13_MeetingScavs_Dek	Text	Where is he?
Narration/&Telema_14_MeetingScavs_Cleric	Text	Resting... he was in pretty bad shape, but he'll be okay.
Narration/&Telema_15_MeetingScavs_Cleric	Text	He said you need help.
Narration/&Telema_16_MeetingScavs_Dek	Text	We did. If only you'd come sooner... .
Narration/&Telema_17_MeetingScavs_Choice	Text	What happened?
Narration/&Telema_18_MeetingScavs_Answer	Text	We came as soon as we could. What happened?
Narration/&Telema_19_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	We know... and thanks.
Narration/&Telema_20_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	Dek here is upset, that's all.
Narration/&Telema_21_MeetingScavs_Dek	Text	I can speak for myself, thank you!
Narration/&Telema_22_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	He thinks we should have left with Runnel.
Narration/&Telema_23_MeetingScavs_Dek	Text	Instead of waiting here for the orcs to kill us?
Narration/&Telema_24_MeetingScavs_Dek	Text	Absolutely, I think we should have left!
Narration/&Telema_25_MeetingScavs_Choice	Text	We're here now.
Narration/&Telema_26_MeetingScavs_Answer	Text	Well we're here now. How can we help?
Narration/&Telema_27_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	Never mind Dek.
Narration/&Telema_28_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	He's upset, that's all.
Narration/&Telema_29_MeetingScavs_Dek	Text	I can speak for myself, thank you!
Narration/&Telema_30_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	He thinks we should have left with Runnel.
Narration/&Telema_31_MeetingScavs_Dek	Text	Instead of waiting for the orcs to kill us?
Narration/&Telema_32_MeetingScavs_Dek	Text	Absolutely, I think we should have left!
Narration/&Telema_33_MeetingScavs_Choice	Text	We could go back.
Narration/&Telema_34_MeetingScavs_Answer	Text	Well, if we're too late, maybe we should just go back.
Narration/&Telema_35_MeetingScavs_Dek	Text	Yes, well, maybe you should!
Narration/&Telema_36_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	Never mind Dek.
Narration/&Telema_37_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	He's upset, that's all.
Narration/&Telema_38_MeetingScavs_Dek	Text	Upset? Why should I be upset? We're just waiting to die, that's all!
Narration/&Telema_39_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	We can't leave Hector in there.
Narration/&Telema_40_MeetingScavs_Dek	Text	He's dead, Lena... dead! It's too late!
Narration/&Telema_41_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	You don't know that!
Narration/&Telema_42_MeetingScavs_Choice	Text	Calm down.
Narration/&Telema_43_MeetingScavs_Answer	Text	Calm down, now. This won't help.
Narration/&Telema_44_MeetingScavs_Choice	Text	We'll help you.
Narration/&Telema_45_MeetingScavs_Answer	Text	It's all right... we're here to help you.
Narration/&Telema_46_MeetingScavs_Choice	Text	Amazing.
Narration/&Telema_47_MeetingScavs_Answer	Text	Why don't you just kill each other and save the orcs some trouble?
Narration/&Telema_48_MeetingScavs_Rogue	Text	What's our help worth to you, anyway?
Narration/&Telema_49_MeetingScavs_Fighter	Text	Stop it!
Narration/&Telema_50_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	Alright.
Narration/&Telema_51_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	What did Runnel tell you?
Narration/&Telema_52_MeetingScavs_Fighter	Text	Just that his team needed help... nothing else.
Narration/&Telema_53_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	We were scavenging in the ruins, and -
Narration/&Telema_54_MeetingScavs_Dek	Text	Orcs! There's a whole tribe in there!
Narration/&Telema_55_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	It was just a raiding party.
Narration/&Telema_56_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	We fought them off... 
Narration/&Telema_57_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	... but they killed some of our people and dragged Hector off.
Narration/&Telema_58_MeetingScavs_Dek	Text	And we've just been waiting here for them to come and finish the job.
Narration/&Telema_59_MeetingScavs_Fighter	Text	They haven't done that yet, though.
Narration/&Telema_60_MeetingScavs_Rogue	Text	Well, you're right about your friend... 
Narration/&Telema_61_MeetingScavs_Rogue	Text	... he must be dead by now.
Narration/&Telema_62_MeetingScavs_Cleric	Text	We don't know that. There is always hope.
Narration/&Telema_63_MeetingScavs_Rogue	Text	Hope? Those orcs had him for dinner the first night.
Narration/&Telema_64_MeetingScavs_Wizard	Text	I don't know... they took him alive, after all... .
Narration/&Telema_65_MeetingScavs_Rogue	Text	So they wanted to keep him fresh... orcs are orcs!
Narration/&Telema_66_MeetingScavs_Fighter	Text	Ignore them. So, we just need to go in and find Hector?
Narration/&Telema_67_MeetingScavs_Dek	Text	Yeah... good luck with that!
Narration/&Telema_68_MeetingScavs_Cleric	Text	Why is he so angry?
Narration/&Telema_69_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	He and Hector don't exactly get along.
Narration/&Telema_70_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	But he's one of our crew... 
Narration/&Telema_71_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	... and I won't leave anyone behind.
Narration/&Telema_72_MeetingScavs_Cleric	Text	We gave our word to your leaders.
Narration/&Telema_73_MeetingScavs_Cleric	Text	We will get Hector back.
Narration/&Telema_74_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	Thanks.
Narration/&Telema_75_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	Do you need food?
Narration/&Telema_76_MeetingScavs_Fighter	Text	You think we'll be away for that long?
Narration/&Telema_77_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	You can never be too careful... 
Narration/&Telema_78_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	... that's the law of the Badlands.
Narration/&Telema_79_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	We can spare some if you need it.
Narration/&Telema_80_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	We have more than we need for just the two of us.
Narration/&Telema_81_MeetingScavs_Dek	Text	Are you serious?
Narration/&Telema_82_MeetingScavs_Dek	Text	You're giving away our food?
Narration/&Telema_83_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	They're risking their lives for us, Dek.
Narration/&Telema_84_MeetingScavs_Dek	Text	For Hector. We can starve, apparently.
Narration/&Telema_85_MeetingScavs_ChoiceIntimidate	Text	The rescuers get the food.
Narration/&Telema_86_MeetingScavs_AnswerIntimidate	Text	The rescuers get the food.
Narration/&Telema_87_MeetingScavs_Fighter	Text	Get it?
Narration/&Telema_88_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess	Text	I don't believe it.
Narration/&Telema_89_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess	Text	That's on you, Lena.
Narration/&Telema_90_MeetingScavs_Lenachecksuccess	Text	Don't worry,
Narration/&Telema_91_MeetingScavs_Lenachecksuccess	Text	that's just the way he is.
Narration/&Telema_92_MeetingScavs_Clericchecksuccess	Text	Thanks, Lena.
Narration/&Telema_93_MeetingScavs_Dekcheckfailed	Text	No.
Narration/&Telema_94_MeetingScavs_Roguecheckfailed	Text	Nice try.
Narration/&Telema_95_MeetingScavs_Fightercheckfailed	Text	Shut up.
Narration/&Telema_96_MeetingScavs_Fighter	Text	We should get moving and find your friend.
Narration/&Telema_97_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	Thanks!
Narration/&Telema_98_MeetingScavs_Lena	Text	And good luck!
Narration/&Telema_99_MeetingScavs_ChoicePersuasion	Text	You're right... keep your food.
Narration/&Telema_100_MeetingScavs_AnswerPersuasion	Text	You're right... keep it. We'll survive.
Narration/&Telema_101_MeetingScavs_Cleric	Text	We'll be back in no time.
Narration/&Telema_102_MeetingScavs_Cleric	Text	If not, you'll have enough to eat.
Narration/&Telema_103_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess	Text	Don't look at me.
Narration/&Telema_104_MeetingScavs_Lenachecksuccess	Text	Just one day of food, Dek.
Narration/&Telema_105_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess	Text	All right, take the damn food!
Narration/&Telema_106_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess	Text	Thank you!
Narration/&Telema_107_MeetingScavs_Dekcheckfailed	Text	Absolutely.
Narration/&Telema_108_MeetingScavs_Choice	Text	Your boss said you'd feed us.
Narration/&Telema_109_MeetingScavs_Answer	Text	Your boss said we could take whatever resources we needed.
Narration/&Telema_110_MeetingScavs_Dek	Text	Did he?
Narration/&Telema_111_MeetingScavs_Rogue	Text	Are you calling me a liar?
Narration/&Telema_112_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess	Text	No.
Narration/&Telema_113_MeetingScavs_Deceptionchecksuccess	Text	So?
Narration/&Telema_114_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess	Text	So take the damn food!
Narration/&Telema_115_MeetingScavs_Dekcheckfailed	Text	Why not?
Narration/&Telema_116_MeetingScavs_Roguecheckfailed	Text	Fair enough.
Narration/&Telema_117_MeetingScavs_Wizardcheckfailed	Text	Impressive negotiation skills.
Narration/&Telema_118_MeetingScavs_Roguecheckfailed	Text	He's stubborn, that's all.
Narration/&TelemaBasReliefTitle	Text	A Sight for Sore Eyes
Narration/&Telema_119_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard	Text	Look at that!
Narration/&Telema_120_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard	Text	Perfectly preserved!
Narration/&Telema_121_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric	Text	What is it?
Narration/&Telema_122_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard	Text	It's a scene from the Imperial conquest of the northern provinces.
Narration/&Telema_123_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric	Text	When the Empire ruled the lands of the Snow Alliance.
Narration/&Telema_124_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric	Text	I can't pretend to feel nostalgic about those times.
Narration/&Telema_125_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard	Text	Nostalgic? That was more than a thousand years ago!
Narration/&Telema_126_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric	Text	The old Empire was built on slavery and racism.
Narration/&Telema_127_Room01_BasRelief_Rogue	Text	Thanks for the (yawn) history lesson.
Narration/&Telema_128_Room01_BasRelief_Rogue	Text	Now... does this look valuable to you?
Narration/&Telema_129_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard	Text	All history is valuable, my friend.
Narration/&Telema_130_Room01_BasRelief_Rogue	Text	Tell that to my purse.
Narration/&Telema_131_Room01_BasRelief_Fighter	Text	Anyway, this doesn't help Hector, so let's move out.
Narration/&TelemaChestTitle	Text	Too good to be True
Narration/&Telema_132_Room01_Chest_Fighter	Text	Well, that's interesting.
Narration/&Telema_133_Room01_Chest_Rogue	Text	You don't say! Look at that!
Narration/&Telema_134_Room01_Chest_Fighter	Text	I'd be careful if I were you.
Narration/&Telema_135_Room01_Chest_Fighter	Text	It looks too good to be true.
Narration/&Telema_136_Room01_Chest_Rogue	Text	That's right. You can't be too careful... 
Narration/&Telema_137_Room01_Chest_Rogue	Text	... that's the law of the Badlands.
Narration/&TelemaStatueTitle	Text	Memory of the Past
Narration/&Telema_138_Room01_Statue_Rogue	Text	Try not to stare... you're making that statue uncomfortable.
Narration/&Telema_139_Room01_Statue_Wizard	Text	But it's... can you read this?
Narration/&Telema_140_Room01_Statue_Rogue	Text	Never had the benefit of an Imperial indoctrin... I mean, education.
Narration/&Telema_141_Room01_Statue_Cleric	Text	That's emperor Gildean the Third.
Narration/&Telema_142_Room01_Statue_Rogue	Text	How do you know?
Narration/&Telema_143_Room01_Statue_Cleric	Text	It's written here.
Narration/&Telema_144_Room01_Statue_Cleric	Text	For those who can read it.
Narration/&Telema_145_Room01_Statue_Rogue	Text	That's nice for you, I'm sure.
Narration/&Telema_146_Room01_Statue_Wizard	Text	His was a very ancient dynasty.
Narration/&Telema_147_Room01_Statue_Wizard	Text	Look at his date of birth.
Narration/&Telema_148_Room01_Statue_Cleric	Text	And location.
Narration/&Telema_149_Room01_Statue_Wizard	Text	Wait! I must copy this.
Narration/&Telema_150_Room01_Statue_Wizard	Text	The Tower will find this interesting.
Narration/&Telema_151_Room01_Statue_Fighter	Text	Are you done?
Narration/&TelemaDoorTitle	Text	Dead End?
Narration/&Telema_152_Room01_Door_Rogue	Text	Can we open it?
Narration/&Telema_153_Room01_Door_Fighter	Text	I don't see how.
Narration/&Telema_154_Room01_Door_Wizard	Text	Must be magically sealed.
Narration/&Telema_155_Room01_Door_Cleric	Text	Do you think a magic seal from Imperial times would still work?
Narration/&Telema_156_Room01_Door_Fighter	Text	In the Badlands, anything's possible.
Narration/&Telema_157_Room01_Door_Rogue	Text	Do you have a spell to open it?
Narration/&Telema_158_Room01_Door_Wizard	Text	No.
Narration/&Telema_159_Room01_Door_Fighter	Text	Let's not waste time, then. Move out!
Narration/&Telema_160_Room01_Crawl_Rogue	Text	They must have gone through here after they took Hector.
Narration/&Telema_161_Room01_Crawl_Cleric	Text	Really? We need to crawl through there?
Narration/&Telema_162_Room01_Crawl_Rogue	Text	Yeah, but you don't mind being on your knees, do you?
Narration/&Telema_163_Room01_Crawl_Cleric	Text	Very funny.
Narration/&Telema_164_OrcCamp_approach_Fighter	Text	I see light ahead!
Narration/&Telema_165_OrcCamp_approach_Rogue	Text	Let me take a look before you go clanking around in your armor.
Narration/&Telema_166_OrcCamp_approach_Fighter	Text	Be careful!
Narration/&Telema_167_OrcCamp_approach_Rogue	Text	Law of the Badlands, my friend.
Narration/&TelemaBackFromReconTitle	Text	Meeting the Locals
Narration/&Telema_168_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue	Text	The orcs are here.
Narration/&Telema_169_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue	Text	Looks like we can sneak around.
Narration/&Telema_170_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Fighter	Text	Even me?
Narration/&Telema_171_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue	Text	Ehh... probably.
Narration/&Telema_172_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Cleric	Text	Did you see Hector?
Narration/&Telema_173_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue	Text	Not a trace.
Narration/&Telema_174_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Fighter	Text	We should attack... we have the element of surprise.
Narration/&Telema_175_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Cleric	Text	But what if Hector's down there too?
Narration/&Telema_176_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Wizard	Text	I hear some orc tribes can be bartered with.
Narration/&Telema_177_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue	Text	Not these orcs.
Narration/&TelemaOrcCampExitTitle	Text	Disappointment...
Narration/&Telema_178_OrcCamp_exit_Fighter	Text	So, no Hector?
Narration/&Telema_179_OrcCamp_exit_Wizard	Text	It doesn't make any sense.
Narration/&Telema_180_OrcCamp_exit_Cleric	Text	Maybe he's further down.
Narration/&Telema_181_OrcCamp_exit_Fighter	Text	All right, let's keep looking.
Narration/&TelemaVerticalEntranceTitle	Text	Lighting the Darkness
Narration/&Telema_182_Vertical_entrance_Fighter	Text	I don't like this.
Narration/&Telema_183_Vertical_entrance_Rogue	Text	We can climb down.
Narration/&Telema_184_Vertical_entrance_Wizard	Text	It's too dark.
Narration/&Telema_185_Vertical_entrance_Cleric	Text	Too unstable, too. These blocks look like they could fall at any minute.
Narration/&Telema_186_Vertical_entrance_Wizard	Text	There's some kind of black oil dripping from the ceiling.
Narration/&Telema_187_Vertical_entrance_Wizard	Text	Maybe we can use it to light up the place.
Narration/&TelemaVerticalExitTitle	Text	No Way Back
Narration/&Telema_188_Vertical_exit_Rogue	Text	Damn it! Now we're stuck!
Narration/&Telema_189_Vertical_exit_Fighter	Text	Do you think the orcs would bring Hector farther in than this?
Narration/&Telema_190_Vertical_exit_Wizard	Text	Not the orcs, no... 
Narration/&Telema_191_Vertical_exit_Wizard	Text	... but something else... maybe.
Narration/&Telema_192_Vertical_exit_Fighter	Text	We've come this far... let's find him.
Narration/&Telema_193_Vertical_exit_Rogue	Text	I'm starting to think we might need that food after all.
Narration/&TelemaShaftEntranceTitle	Text	Unexpected Denizens
Narration/&Telema_194_Shaft_entrance_Cleric	Text	What is this... an amphitheater?
Narration/&Telema_195_Shaft_entrance_Wizard	Text	A very special one.
Narration/&Telema_196_Shaft_entrance_Rogue	Text	Not room for much of a crowd... .
Narration/&Telema_197_Shaft_entrance_Wizard	Text	Students of magic. The Masters taught spells here.
Narration/&Telema_198_Shaft_entrance_Fighter	Text	Do spiders like magic shows?
Narration/&Telema_199_Shaft_entrance_Fighter	Text	Because I see a lot of webs.
Narration/&Telema_200_Shaft_entrance_Wizard	Text	Deep spiders. We will have to be careful.
Narration/&Telema_201_Shaft_entrance_Fighter	Text	Deep spiders?
Narration/&Telema_202_Shaft_entrance_Cleric	Text	Very large and aggressive, but sensitive to light.
Narration/&Telema_203_Shaft_entrance_Rogue	Text	Just how large is very large?
Narration/&Telema_204_Shaft_entrance_Wizard	Text	Just keep your lights ready... .
Narration/&Telema_205_Shaft_entrance_Wizard	Text	... and your oil handy.
Narration/&Telema_206_Shaft_entrance_Wizard	Text	The more light we have, the fewer spiders we'll face.
Narration/&Telema_207_Shaft_entrance_Fighter	Text	We don't have a choice here. The only way out is up.
Narration/&TelemaShaftUpperTitle	Text	A way out?
Narration/&Telema_208_Shaft_upper_Fighter	Text	How many are there?
Narration/&Telema_209_Shaft_upper_Rogue	Text	You don't want to know.
Narration/&Telema_210_Shaft_upper_Cleric	Text	Try pushing this down!
Narration/&Telema_211_Shaft_upper_Cleric	Text	I feel a weakness here.
Narration/&TelemaShaftCollapsedTitle	Text	Escape... to Hector!
Narration/&Telema_212_Shaft_collapsed_Wizard	Text	Well done!
Narration/&Telema_213_Shaft_collapsed_Rogue	Text	You sure they're dead?
Narration/&Telema_214_Shaft_collapsed_Fighter	Text	Well, they're not coming back.
Narration/&Telema_215_Shaft_collapsed_Rogue	Text	Good.
Narration/&Telema_216_Shaft_collapsed_Cleric	Text	My friends, I believe I have found Hector.
Narration/&Telema_217_Rescue_Hector	Text	By all the gods at once... thank you!
Narration/&Telema_218_Rescue_Fighter	Text	Are you Hector?
Narration/&Telema_219_Rescue_Hector	Text	Yes! And you?
Narration/&Telema_220_Rescue_Fighter	Text	The boss sent us. Ronnel went for help.
Narration/&Telema_221_Rescue_Hector	Text	Runnel! So he survived?
Narration/&Telema_222_Rescue_Cleric	Text	Barely, but yes.
Narration/&Telema_223_Rescue_Cleric	Text	He's safely back in town.
Narration/&Telema_224_Rescue_Rogue	Text	So, did the spiders take you?
Narration/&Telema_225_Rescue_Hector	Text	The orcs did, after their raid.
Narration/&Telema_226_Rescue_Hector	Text	They kept me for a while.
Narration/&Telema_227_Rescue_Hector	Text	I was wondering why.
Narration/&Telema_228_Rescue_Hector	Text	I finally got the answer when they... 
Narration/&Telema_229_Rescue_Hector	Text	... well, they sacrificied me.
Narration/&Telema_230_Rescue_Fighter	Text	What?
Narration/&Telema_231_Rescue_Hector	Text	They feed the spiders. So they don't get eaten themselves.
Narration/&Telema_232_Rescue_Hector	Text	They leave captives at the top of the amphitheater.
Narration/&Telema_233_Rescue_Rogue	Text	Oh, that one?
Narration/&Telema_234_Rescue_Rogue	Text	We kind of... destroyed it.
Narration/&Telema_235_Rescue_Fighter	Text	The spider nest, too.
Narration/&Telema_236_Rescue_Hector	Text	Interesting.
Narration/&Telema_237_Rescue_Hector	Text	I'm not sure how the orcs will react to that.
Narration/&Telema_238_Rescue_Hector	Text	This spider cult seemed important to them.
Narration/&Telema_239_Rescue_Fighter	Text	Can't say I feel sorry for them.
Narration/&Telema_240_Rescue_Hector	Text	I owe you my life. Thanks again.
Narration/&Telema_241_Rescue_Cleric	Text	You are most welcome.
Narration/&Telema_242_Rescue_Fighter	Text	You should rest, and I think we should do the same.
Narration/&Telema_243_Rescue_Hector	Text	Good idea.
Narration/&Telema_244_Rescue_Choice	Text	What's your story?
Narration/&Telema_245_Rescue_Answer	Text	So Hector, what's your story?
Narration/&Telema_246_Rescue_Hector	Text	Me? I'm just another Scavenger, really.
Narration/&Telema_247_Rescue_Hector	Text	I make a living bringing old stuff out of the Badlands.
Narration/&Telema_248_Rescue_Choice	Text	What about Lena and Dek?
Narration/&Telema_249_Rescue_Answer	Text	Do you know Lena and Dek? They seem like quite a pair!
Narration/&Telema_250_Rescue_Hector	Text	Oh, those two... always fighting over something.
Narration/&Telema_251_Rescue_Hector	Text	But you couldn't separate them if you wanted to.
Narration/&Telema_252_Rescue_Fighter	Text	They seemed pretty much at each other's throats.
Narration/&Telema_253_Rescue_Hector	Text	Yeah, like I said... always fighting.
Narration/&Telema_254_Rescue_Hector	Text	But in battle, always back to back.
Narration/&Telema_255_Rescue_Rogue	Text	Aww... that's so sweet.
Narration/&Telema_256_Rescue_Choice	Text	Did you find anything good in here?
Narration/&Telema_257_Rescue_Answer	Text	Did you find anything good in the ruins?
Narration/&Telema_258_Rescue_Hector	Text	No, not much. You've seen the state of the place... 
Narration/&Telema_259_Rescue_Hector	Text	... but there was something.
Narration/&Telema_260_Rescue_Hector	Text	Didn't have time to use it.
Narration/&Telema_261_Rescue_Fighter	Text	What is it?
Narration/&Telema_262_Rescue_Rogue	Text	A key?
Narration/&Telema_263_Rescue_Hector	Text	I think it opens the door in the ruins.
Narration/&Telema_264_Rescue_Rogue	Text	Oh, yeah... that door.
Narration/&Telema_265_Rescue_Hector	Text	At least, I hope it does.
Narration/&Telema_266_Rescue_Hector	Text	Not much else, though. I think the orcs got it all.
Narration/&Telema_267_Rescue_Choice	Text	You're a cleric of Einar?
Narration/&Telema_268_Rescue_Answer	Text	You're wearing the flaming sword.
Narration/&Telema_269_Rescue_Hector	Text	And I can see you're from the order of the Beacon.
Narration/&Telema_270_Rescue_Cleric	Text	Are you a priest, Hector?
Narration/&Telema_271_Rescue_Hector	Text	Just a humble follower.
Narration/&Telema_272_Rescue_Hector	Text	This was given to me by one of your brothers.
Narration/&Telema_273_Rescue_Hector	Text	We fought together... he felt like he owed me.
Narration/&Telema_274_Rescue_Hector	Text	And he gave me this.
Narration/&Telema_275_After_Rest_Fighter	Text	I think we're all ready to go.
Narration/&Telema_276_After_Rest_Wizard	Text	Indeed.
Narration/&Telema_277_After_Rest_Cleric	Text	I think we're close to the surface.
Narration/&Telema_278_After_Rest_Cleric	Text	I can feel it.
Narration/&Telema_279_After_Rest_Fighter	Text	All right... let's move.
Narration/&Telema_280_Ambush_Fighter	Text	Orcs! Over there!
Narration/&Telema_281_Ambush_Rogue	Text	It's an ambush!
Narration/&Telema_282_Ambush_Fighter	Text	Time to fight!
Narration/&Telema_283_WayBack_Fighter	Text	Hey! Take a look at this.
Narration/&Telema_284_WayBack_Cleric	Text	The stone is carved.
Narration/&Telema_285_WayBack_Fighter	Text	Are we back near the ruins?
Narration/&Telema_286_WayBack_Cleric	Text	It looks fragile, let's try pushing it.
Narration/&Telema_287_WayBack_Fighter	Text	Well done... we're back in the ruins!
Narration/&Telema_288_WayBack_Rogue	Text	So, do you still have that key?
Narration/&Telema_289_WayBack_Hector	Text	Sure.
Narration/&Telema_290_WayBack_Hector	Text	Take it.
Narration/&Telema_291_Magic_Door_Wizard	Text	Amazing!
Narration/&Telema_292_Magic_Door_Wizard	Text	This room hasn't been opened in a millenium!
Narration/&Telema_293_Magic_Door_Cleric	Text	Those books are falling into pieces.
Narration/&Telema_294_Magic_Door_Wizard	Text	Not this one!
Narration/&Telema_295_Magic_Door_Cleric	Text	Look around for other valuables.
Narration/&Telema_296_Magic_Door_Rogue	Text	Already doing it!
Narration/&Telema_297_Exit_Temple_Lena	Text	Hey! Here they are!
Narration/&Telema_298_Exit_Temple_Dek	Text	I'll be damned... they're alive!
Narration/&Telema_299_Exit_Temple_Fighter	Text	We told you we'd find him.
Narration/&Telema_300_Exit_Temple_Lena	Text	Hector?
Narration/&Telema_301_Exit_Temple_Dek	Text	Lena, wait!
Narration/&Telema_302_Exit_Temple_Cleric	Text	What's going on?
Narration/&Telema_303_Exit_Temple_Lena	Text	That's not Hector!
Narration/&Telema_304_Exit_Temple_Fighter	Text	What?
Narration/&Telema_305_Exit_Temple_Rogue	Text	Then just who are you, friend?
Narration/&Telema_306_Exit_Temple_Hector	Text	Put down your weapons.
Narration/&Telema_307_Exit_Temple_Fighter	Text	Why would we do that?
Narration/&Tavern_01_1_Stealth_Normal	Text	This beer tastes like donkey piss. Not that I'm complaining.
Narration/&Tavern_01_2_Explorer_Default	Text	Hope I'm not too late.
Narration/&Tavern_01_3_Explorer_Normal	Text	Ran into a bit of trouble on the way here.
Narration/&Tavern_01_4_Spellcaster_Normal	Text	Take the load off. There's plenty of donkey piss to go around. 
Narration/&Tavern_01_5_Spellcaster_Formal	Text	Sit. Relax. Perhaps you'd enjoy a pint of this obnoxious ale?
Narration/&Tavern_01_6_Fighter_Default	Text	Here for the Council job? Join the club. 
Narration/&Tavern_01_7_Fighter_Authoritative	Text	If you're here for the Council job, get in line.
Narration/&Tavern_01_8_Fighter_Friendly	Text	You're not too late, friend. We're all here for the same reason. 
Narration/&Tavern_01_9_Fighter_Default	Text	Apparently, Lord Carran likes to keep people waiting.
Narration/&Tavern_01_10_Fighter_Authoritative	Text	Though if this Lord Carran doesn't show up soon, I may go looking for him.
Narration/&Tavern_01_11_Fighter_Friendly	Text	Grab a chair. 
Narration/&Tavern_01_12_Stealth_Default	Text	Another round, barkeeper. Four of your finest flagons of donkey piss, please!
Narration/&Tavern_01_13_Explorer_Default	Text	Looks like you've been waiting here a while.
Narration/&Tavern_01_13_Explorer_Formal	Text	I see you're all making the best of this.
Narration/&Tavern_01_13_Explorer_Slang	Text	So is this the job? Getting shitfaced?
Narration/&Tavern_01_14_Spellcaster_Normal	Text	We do what we have to. So what's this trouble you were telling us about?
Narration/&Tavern_01_15_Spellcaster_Formal	Text	Indeed. You mentioned something about some trouble. Would you care to elaborate?
Narration/&Tavern_01_16_Explorer_Normal	Text	Well, I was making my way here… 
Narration/&Tavern_01_17_Explorer_Normal	Text	…when three bandits leapt out of the bushes with crossbows. 
Narration/&Tavern_01_18_Explorer_Normal	Text	They dragged me off to some decrepit prison… 
Narration/&Tavern_01_19_Explorer_Normal	Text	…and tossed me in a filthy cell that smelled of rat piss.
Narration/&Tavern_01_20_Explorer_Slang	Text	Well, I was heading down a lonely road… 
Narration/&Tavern_01_21_Explorer_Slang	Text	…when three shitheads jumped from the bushes, dragged me off… 
Narration/&Tavern_01_22_Explorer_Slang	Text	…and threw my ass in this rundown jail.
Narration/&Tavern_01_23_Explorer_Slang	Text	Smelled like some poor bastard had died in there.
Narration/&Tavern_01_24_Explorer_Formal	Text	I was heading down the highway, minding my own business…
Narration/&Tavern_01_25_Explorer_Formal	Text	…when three brigands burst out of the bushes and waylaid me.
Narration/&Tavern_01_26_Explorer_Formal	Text	They carried me off to some ramshackle prison.
Narration/&Tavern_01_27_Explorer_Formal	Text	An Imperial ruin of some sort… 
Narration/&Tavern_01_28_Explorer_Formal	Text	Fortunately, the walls were as weak as this mediocre ale we're drinking.
Narration/&Tavern_01_29_Explorer_Normal	Text	…Don't know what was holding the place up… 
Narration/&Tavern_01_29_Explorer_Slang	Text	…a strong wind coulda taken it down.
Narration/&Tavern_02_1_Fighter_Normal	Text	Nice move, that trick with the wall. Glad you're no worse for wear.
Narration/&Tavern_02_2_Fighter_Formal	Text	So you escaped unscathed. Well done, my friend!
Narration/&Tavern_02_3_Explorer_Normal	Text	My flagon is empty of ale, and Lord Carran still isn't here.
Narration/&Tavern_02_4_Explorer_Cynical	Text	Perhaps someone else can tell a story since it looks like we might be here a while. 
Narration/&Tavern_02_5_Explorer_Lawful	Text	This Council needs to get organized. They have no right to keep us waiting like this. 
Narration/&Tavern_02_6_Spellcaster_Normal	Text	Have another ale. It's not like you have anywhere better to be.
Narration/&Tavern_02_7_Spellcaster_Greedy	Text	I don't mind waiting as long as they pay us for our darned time. 
Narration/&Tavern_02_8_Spellcaster_Aristocrat	Text	The Council is likely busy with important matters of state, and we are not, so have patience.
Narration/&Tavern_02_9_Spellcaster_Lowlife	Text	You think the Council cares about the likes of us? They'll get to us when they're good and ready.
Narration/&Tavern_02_10_Fighter_Normal	Text	Well, let me tell you my story then. I, too, was accosted on the way here, but I faced my foes head on. 
Narration/&Tavern_02_11_Fighter_Violent	Text	I have a tale to tell as well. I, too, was attacked, but I put an end to my enemies with blood and pain.
Narration/&Tavern_02_12_Stealth_Slang	Text	So what are you waiting for? Spit it out, why don't you?
Narration/&Tavern_02_13_Stealth_Normal	Text	Let's hear it, then. Don't be shy.
Narration/&Tavern_02_14_Stealth_Formal	Text	Proceed, then. Everyone enjoys a tale well told.
Narration/&Tavern_02_15_Merton_Default	Text	What a bunch namby-pambies! You're lucky you weren't attacked by Soraks!
Narration/&Tavern_02_16_Fighter_Normal	Text	I don't remember anyone asking your opinion.
Narration/&Tavern_02_17_Fighter_Violent	Text	Shut your mouth, or I'll shut it for ya!
Narration/&Tavern_02_18_Fighter_Friendly	Text	That's right, buddy. It's always good to be lucky.
Narration/&Tavern_02_19_Merton_Default	Text	The Badlands are thick with 'em. Shapeshifting bastards!
Narration/&Tavern_02_20_Stealth_Normal	Text	Never mind him. He's just another drunk Scavenger.
Narration/&Tavern_02_21_Stealth_Cynical	Text	Everyone's a critic.
Narration/&Tavern_02_22_Stealth_Einar	Text	I'm so tired of stupid drunks ranting about mythical creatures.
Narration/&Tavern_02_23_Explorer_Default	Text	Aren't all drunks basically stupid?
Narration/&Tavern_02_24_Spellcaster_Default	Text	Soraks might be legend, but orcs are quite real, and not just in the Badlands.
Narration/&Tavern_02_25_Spellcaster_Default	Text	…I stumbled across a secret settlement right here in the Principality.
Narration/&Tavern_02_26_Fighter_Normal	Text	What?
Narration/&Tavern_02_27_Fighter_Slang	Text	Bullshit!
Narration/&Tavern_02_28_Fighter_Formal	Text	That is preposterous.
Narration/&Tavern_02_29_Spellcaster_Normal	Text	High in the hills, two days west of here.
Narration/&Tavern_02_30_Spellcaster_Normal	Text	I left the main road to find a shorter way through… 
Narration/&Tavern_02_31_Spellcaster_Normal	Text	And I was making good time… 
Narration/&Tavern_02_32_Spellcaster_Normal	Text	…when I dropped through a frickin' sinkhole into a cave.
Narration/&Tavern_02_33_Spellcaster_Slang	Text	I was dragging my weary ass up the hills west of here… 
Narration/&Tavern_02_34_Spellcaster_Slang	Text	…and decided to leave the road to look for a shortcut.
Narration/&Tavern_02_35_Spellcaster_Slang	Text	It was beautiful day. Blue skies. Birds singing. I watched one take wing… 
Narration/&Tavern_02_36_Spellcaster_Slang	Text	…and fell right into a blasted hole.
Narration/&Tavern_02_37_Spellcaster_Formal	Text	I traveled here from the east, and left the main highway… 
Narration/&Tavern_02_38_Spellcaster_Formal	Text	…hoping to save time by traversing the hills.
Narration/&Tavern_02_39_Spellcaster_Formal	Text	The views were magnificent, but I should have kept my eye on the path.
Narration/&Tavern_02_40_Spellcaster_Formal	Text	Because it gave way beneath my feet, plunging me into gloomy darkness. 
Narration/&Tavern_03_1_Fighter_Selfpres	Text	Not sure I would have slept so close to a horde of orcs.
Narration/&Tavern_03_2_Fighter_Violence	Text	I would have slaughtered every one of those green-skinned monsters.
Narration/&Tavern_03_3_Fighter_Cynical	Text	You slept with a bunch of orcs? That explains the smell.
Narration/&Tavern_03_4_Spellcaster_Default	Text	Orcs have a very distinctive stink.
Narration/&Tavern_03_5_Stealth_Cynical	Text	I'm beginning to think Lord Carran might be a mythical creature. 
Narration/&Tavern_03_6_Stealth_Violence	Text	If Lord Carran keeps us waiting much longer, I might greet him with a dagger.
Narration/&Tavern_03_7_Stealth_Lawful	Text	We should bill the Council for all this wasted time.
Narration/&Tavern_03_8_Explorer_Default	Text	We've all told a tale of our travels here. All but one of us.
Narration/&Tavern_03_9_Stealth_Default	Text	Yes, but I have a good reason for that. It's none of your damn business.
Narration/&Tavern_03_10_Fighter_Slang	Text	Come on, now. Don't be a killjoy. We all sang for our supper. Now it's your turn!
Narration/&Tavern_03_11_Fighter_Formal	Text	We can't take up arms together if we don't trust each other. 
Narration/&Tavern_03_12_Fighter_Normal	Text	You can't have a true friendship without trust. What are you hiding?
Narration/&Tavern_03_13_Stealth_Default	Text	Fine - you want to know the truth?
Narration/&Tavern_03_14_Stealth_Default	Text	I stopped on the way here to visit an old friend of mine… 
Narration/&Tavern_03_15_Stealth_Default	Text	And discovered he was up to his eyeballs in debt with a loan shark.
Narration/&Tavern_03_16_Explorer_Normal	Text	Oh, that's not good.
Narration/&Tavern_03_17_Explorer_Slang	Text	Sounds like an idiot.
Narration/&Tavern_03_18_Explorer_Formal	Text	So he was in dire straits?
Narration/&Tavern_03_19_Stealth_Default	Text	Indeed. He put up a family heirloom as collateral and wanted me to reacquire it.
Narration/&Tavern_03_20_Stealth_Default	Text	Because, you see, I can be quite stealthy when necessary. 
Narration/&Tavern_041_Carran_NPC	Text	Are you four here to see Lord Carran?
Narration/&Tavern_042_Stealth_Cynical_WRITTEN	Text	We're not here to get drunk.
Narration/&Tavern_043_Stealth_Pragmatic_WRITTEN	Text	Who's asking?
Narration/&Tavern_044_Stealth_Violence_WRITTEN	Text	Maybe we're here looking for a fight.
Narration/&Tavern_042_Stealth_Cynical	Text	Well, we're not here to drink ourselves to death.
Narration/&Tavern_043_Stealth_Pragmatic	Text	Depends on who's asking.
Narration/&Tavern_044_Stealth_Violence	Text	Maybe. Or maybe we're here just to raise hell and break heads.
Narration/&Tavern_045_Carran_cynical_NPC	Text	Well, thank you for making that clear…
Narration/&Tavern_045_Carran_violent_NPC	Text	A fight, is it? I'm sure we can find an outlet for your… enthusiasm.
Narration/&Tavern_045_Carran_NPC	Text	Well, if you are here for Lord Carran of the Legacy Council, that would be me.
Narration/&Tavern_046_Fighter_Cynical_WRITTEN	Text	So you're real, then?
Narration/&Tavern_047_Fighter_Lawful_WRITTEN	Text	We're ready.
Narration/&Tavern_048_Fighter_Greedy_WRITTEN	Text	We should get paid for waiting.
Narration/&Tavern_046_Fighter_Cynical	Text	So you're not a mythical creature after all.
Narration/&Tavern_047_Fighter_Lawful	Text	Then we are here at your service, sir.
Narration/&Tavern_048_Fighter_Greedy	Text	Fine. I'd like to present you with a bill for the time we just spent cooling our heels.
Narration/&Tavern_049_Carran_Cynical	Text	Unlike, say, a sober adventurer?
Narration/&Tavern_049_Carran_Lawful	Text	Very good.
Narration/&Tavern_049_Carran_Greedy	Text	Feel free. The Council's bursary enjoys a good laugh.
Narration/&Tavern_049_01_Authority_Formal	Text	Might we ask a bit more about this quest of yours, sir, if you please?
Narration/&Tavern_049_01_Authority_Normal	Text	Can you tell us more about the job?
Narration/&Tavern_049_01_Authority_Slang	Text	We kinda need a little bit more info 'bout the job, milord.
Narration/&Tavern_049_02_Carran_NPC	Text	Well, I suppose it's better if you know what you're doing. 
Narration/&Tavern_049_03_Carran_NPC	Text	What do you want to know?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_WRITTEN	Text	About the Legacy Council.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_WRITTEN	Text	About the Principality.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_WRITTEN	Text	Are you our employer?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_ExitLine_WRITTEN	Text	We're good, thank you.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_ExitLine_Audio	Text	We should be going, don't you think?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Choice	Text	What can you tell us about this place, the Principality?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran01	Text	We don't exactly have the time…
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran02	Text	…anyway. The Principality of Masgarth is ruled by Princess Ceiwad Silverflower.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran03	Text	We are a wealthy state, with fertile lands, and the easiest access to the Badlands…
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran04	Text	…through a pass called the Copperhead Road.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran05	Text	We're in the capital, Caer Cyflen, which was once part of the ancient Manacalon Empire of the high elves.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran06	Text	Hence the magnificent elvish buildings up there in the high town.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran07	Text	While we don't have a state religion, all of the major faiths on Solasta are represented here…
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran08	Text	…though we tend to favor Einar, the god of valor and fidelity.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_Choice	Text	Are we going to work for you?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_Carran01	Text	Not exactly, no. I'll be your contact with the Legacy Council, which you will serve as deputies.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_Carran02	Text	That's why we need to go there and get you sworn in.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Choice	Text	We hear this is a mission for the Council, but what is it, exactly?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran01	Text	Dear Maraike! You don't know?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran02	Text	I'll try to make it simple, but you know - politics…
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran03	Text	The Council includes representatives of the most powerful and influential organizations in the Eastern Kingdoms.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran04	Text	It was created to lead a joint effort to explore the Badlands.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_WRITTEN	Text	What are the Badlands?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Choice	Text	What are the Badlands, really?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Carran01	Text	Simply put, they are a monster-ridden, chaotic wasteland that used to be the elven empire called Manacalon.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Carran02	Text	It was destroyed about a thousand years ago by the great Cataclysm.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Carran03	Text	Now, only ruins remain, full of forgotten knowledge, riches, and dangers.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_WRITTEN	Text	What are the Eastern Kingdoms?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Choice	Text	Which countries make up these Eastern Kingdoms?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran01	Text	Simple. The Principality of Masgarth, here, is in the center.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran02	Text	The Snow Alliance lies to the north.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran03	Text	The Kingdom of Gallivan, to the east.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran04	Text	And the New Empire, to the south.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran05	Text	All friendly, more or less, but the peace is fragile.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_WRITTEN	Text	What organizations are there?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Choice	Text	What are the organizations you mentioned?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran01	Text	The Council is… how to put it? A non-governmental organization.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran02	Text	Meaning that state governments are not represented, to avoid partisanship.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran03	Text	Instead, there are delegates from the Guild of Antiquarians, the Tower of Knowledge, the Arcaneum, and the Circle of Danantar.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran04	Text	And the Church of Einar guarantees fairness, led by Marshal Beric Sunblaze and Oathkeeper Leira Kean.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_ExitLine_WRITTEN	Text	We know enough.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_ExitLine_Choice	Text	I think we know enough now. Thank you!
Narration/&Tavern_049_Additional_Carran_NPC	Text	Very well.
Narration/&Tavern_049_Carran_NPC	Text	Come! Gather your things. You're late for your swearing in.
Narration/&Tavern_0410_Stealth_Lawful	Text	Whose fault is that? 
Narration/&Tavern_0411_Stealth_Cynical	Text	Hurry up and wait. The story of my life.
Narration/&Tavern_0412_Stealth_Academic	Text	I, for one, am very curious to see the inside of that Council room.
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_FindTools	Text	Liam… always thoughtful.
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_Liam_01	Text	There you are, you filthy crook!
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_LoanShark	Text	You? What…? You're drunk! Get out of here before I kill you!
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_Liam_02	Text	Think you scare me? Not anymore!
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_LoanShark2	Text	A grave mistake.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_FallRecover_Normal	Text	Ow! I must have fallen on my wrong side… 
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_FallRecover_Formal	Text	Ow! That's going to leave a mark.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_FallRecover_Slang	Text	Damn! That hurt like hell.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_nosy	Text	Orcs, here? Strange. I wonder what this totem means.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_lukewarm	Text	Just my luck, falling right into an orc hideout!
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_wisecracker	Text	Orcs? Of course, that explains the smell… 
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_highclass	Text	My word, this is an orc hideout! The malodor is unmistakable.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_preachy	Text	Orcs? Clearly I'm being punished for leaving the road. Now to seek redemption.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_judgmental	Text	Orcs, here? I must report this… which means, I must get out of here alive.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_mean	Text	Damn me, like I needed to fall into an orc shithole!
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_logical	Text	An orc hideout right in the middle of the Principality… how surprising. Let's hope they've eaten recently.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_failure_normal	Text	What the… ? Whatever this is, it's not good.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_failure_formal	Text	What a peculiar style of art… clearly the work of some savage hand.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_failure_slang	Text	Charming, that. Just as long as my head doesn't end up on the top.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs	Text	There they are… 
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs2_normal	Text	…if they see me, I'm dead.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs2_formal	Text	…discretion is clearly the better part of valor in this instance.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs2_slang	Text	…head down, or I'm next on the menu.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs3_normal	Text	What's worse, it looks like this is the only way out.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs3_formal	Text	No other means of egress is apparent.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs3_slang	Text	They're camped right by the only exit? It just keeps getting better!
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs4_normal	Text	I just need to be patient. They can't stay there forever.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs4_formal	Text	Fine, then, I shall wait until they go. These creatures do hunt, right?
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs4_slang	Text	Guess I'm waiting them out. At least these rocks are… damned uncomfortable.
Narration/&Council_00_1_Wow_Default	Text	Look at this size of this Council hall!
Narration/&Council_00_2_Wow_Default	Text	A very impressive edifice indeed.
Narration/&Council_00_3_joker_Default	Text	So this is what they spend our taxes on.
Narration/&Council_00_4_Any_Default	Text	Look! Is that… 
Narration/&Council_00_5_Any_Default	Text	The Princess!
Narration/&Council_00_6_Any_Default	Text	Wait… is she leaving?
Narration/&Council_00_7_joker_Default	Text	Apparently so… 
Narration/&Council_00_8_Any_Default	Text	Then who will administer the oath?
Narration/&Council_00_9_joker_Default_WRITTEN	Text	The maid who empties her chamber pot?
Narration/&Council_00_9_mean_Default_WRITTEN	Text	We're too low for her.
Narration/&Council_00_9_anyother_Default_WRITTEN	Text	It's not her role.
Narration/&Council_00_9_joker_Default	Text	The maid who empties her chamber pot? No, we're not as important as that. Perhaps her stable boy.
Narration/&Council_00_9_joker_Slang	Text	A lady like her wants nothing to do with drudges like us.
Narration/&Council_00_9_anyother_Default_Choice	Text	There's an Oathkeeper for that, I think.
Narration/&Council_00_10_Carran_NPC	Text	You thought it would be the Princess? 
Narration/&Council_00_11_Any_Default_WRITTEN	Text	She doesn't rule the Council?
Narration/&Council_00_11_Any_Default_Who_WRITTEN	Text	If not her, then who?
Narration/&Council_00_11_Any_Default	Text	Doesn't she lead the Council?
Narration/&Council_00_12_Carran_NPC	Text	No, in this chamber, she's just another delegate.
Narration/&Council_00_11_Any_Default_Who_Choice	Text	If she rules the whole Principality, who's more important?
Narration/&Council_00_12_Carran_NPC_02	Text	Lady Kean, the Council's Oathkeeper, is trusted by all.
Narration/&Council_00_15_Chamberlain_NPC	Text	Lord Carran!
Narration/&Council_00_16_Carran_NPC	Text	Yes, m'lady!
Narration/&Council_00_17_Chamberlain_NPC	Text	Are these your new deputies?
Narration/&Council_00_18_Carran_NPC	Text	They are, m'lady.
Narration/&Council_00_19_Serious_Default	Text	Very well. Pay attention. All of you.
Narration/&Council_00_20_Serious_Slang	Text	Pipe down. 
Narration/&Council_00_20_Serious_Normal	Text	Shhh, quiet everyone!
Narration/&Council_00_21_Chamberlain_NPC	Text	My name is Leira Kean, Oathkeeper of the Council.
Narration/&Council_00_22_Chamberlain_NPC	Text	And I will be administering your vows.
Narration/&Council_00_23_Chamberlain_NPC	Text	Once sworn in, you will carry the authority of the Council wherever you go.
Narration/&Council_00_24_Chamberlain_NPC	Text	Your every action will reflect upon the Council's reputation. Remember that. Always.
Narration/&Council_00_25_Chamberlain_NPC	Text	Now, please, raise your right hands.
Narration/&Council_00_26_Chamberlain_NPC	Text	Do you, each and all, solemnly swear your lives and allegiance to this Council and promise… 
Narration/&Council_00_27_Chamberlain_NPC	Text	…to carry out our mission to protect our alliance from those who would threaten the common good?
Narration/&Council_00_28_All_Default_WRITTEN	Text	I swear.
Narration/&Council_00_28_All_Default	Text	I swear.
Narration/&Council_00_29_Chamberlain_NPC	Text	Excellent. Lord Carran will enter your name into Council's register. Thank you for your service.
Narration/&Council_00_30_Carran_NPC	Text	Congratulations, deputies.
Narration/&Council_00_31_Any_Default	Text	Wait, that's it?
Narration/&Council_00_32_Joke_WRITTEN	Text	You were expecting a parade?
Narration/&Council_00_32_Longenough_WRITTEN	Text	That was long enough.
Narration/&Council_00_32_Exitline_WRITTEN	Text	Let's focus on the mission.
Narration/&Council_00_32_joker_Default	Text	What were you expecting? A parade? 
Narration/&Council_00_32_joker_Slang	Text	Were you hoping for a kiss from the Princess?
Narration/&Council_00_33_Any_Default	Text	I suppose you imagined something more pompous.
Narration/&Council_00_34_Any_Default	Text	No. I don't know. It just feels a bit… anticlimactic.
Narration/&Council_00_35_Carran_NPC	Text	Sorry to disappoint. 
Narration/&Council_00_32_Longenough_Choice	Text	Frankly, the speech was long enough for my taste.
Narration/&Council_00_32_Longenough_Carran01	Text	The formality reflects the solemnity of your oath.
Narration/&Council_00_32_Longenough_Carran02	Text	But more would probably be… immodest.
Narration/&Council_00_32_Exitline_Choice	Text	Stop wasting time! What's the mission?
Narration/&Council_00_32_Exitline_Carran	Text	Well! A motivated deputy.
Narration/&Council_00_42_Carran_NPC	Text	So - the mission:
Narration/&Council_00_44_Carran_NPC	Text	As I'm sure you know, the Council maintains a number of outposts… 
Narration/&Council_00_45_Carran_NPC	Text	…to secure the border between the Principality and the Marches.
Narration/&Council_00_46_Carran_NPC	Text	One of them is the former Imperial Fortress, Caer Lem.
Narration/&Council_00_47_Carran_NPC	Text	It is held by some fifty troops under the command of Captain Henrik.
Narration/&Council_00_48_Carran_NPC	Text	He sends us weekly status reports - or rather, he used to.
Narration/&Council_00_49_Carran_NPC	Text	We haven't heard a word from him in three weeks.
Narration/&Council_00_50_Carran_NPC	Text	Leave immediately for Caer Lem and find out if anyone there is still alive.
Narration/&Council_00_51_Carran_NPC	Text	If Captain Henrik or anyone else is still breathing, bring them back.
Narration/&Council_00_52_Carran_NPC	Text	The Council wants a first-hand report.
Narration/&Council_00_53_Dangerous_WRITTEN	Text	Sounds dangerous.
Narration/&Council_00_54_Marches_WRITTEN	Text	Wait - you spoke of the Marches?
Narration/&Council_00_55_Henrik_WRITTEN	Text	Tell us about Captain Henrik.
Narration/&Council_00_56_ExitLine_WRITTEN	Text	We're good to go.
Narration/&Council_00_57_Dangerous_Choice	Text	A whole garrison, gone? There are only four of us.
Narration/&Council_00_58_Dangerous_Carran01	Text	Just find out what happened. Run back if you get scared.
Narration/&Council_00_42_Joker_Normal	Text	Got it. Though we were hoping for a first mission with more riches than risk, if you catch my drift.
Narration/&Council_00_42_Joker_Slang	Text	We hear ya. Just so you know, we'd like to start slow. Meaning more treasure. Less danger.
Narration/&Council_00_59_Carran_NPC	Text	You don't get to choose your mission, I'm afraid.
Narration/&Council_00_53_Carran_NPC	Text	So gather what you need and go. Time is of the essence.
Narration/&Council_00_60_Marches_Choice	Text	Wait! These Marches - they're not in the Badlands, are they?
Narration/&Council_00_61_Marches_Carran01	Text	The Marches are a no-man's-land, between the civilized world and the Badlands.
Narration/&Council_00_62_Marches_Carran02	Text	It's outside the chain of mountains that really define the Badlands.
Narration/&Council_00_63_Marches_Carran03	Text	We wouldn't send you in there… yet.
Narration/&Council_00_64_Henrik_Choice	Text	What can you tell us about this Captain Henrik?
Narration/&Council_00_65_Henrik_Carran01	Text	A fine officer. More than fifteen years in the Principality's army.
Narration/&Council_00_66_Henrik_Carran02	Text	He inspires trust, loyalty, and courage - hence the decision to post him there, facing danger.
Narration/&Council_00_54_Any_Default	Text	Right, I guess that's that. It's on to Caer Lem.
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_1_PotionShopOwner_NPC	Text	Hello! How may I help you?
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_2_Any_WRITTEN	Text	What do you sell?
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_3_Any_WRITTEN	Text	Can we see your wares?
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_4_Any_Default	Text	What do you sell here?
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_5_PotionShopOwner_NPC	Text	Mostly potions, for heroic adventurers like yourselves.
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_6_PotionShopOwner_NPC	Text	I also have recipes for customers who like to craft their own.
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_7_PotionShopOwner_NPC	Text	And ingredients too - even rare flowers from the Badlands.
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_8_PotionShopOwner_NPC	Text	Come back any time - I'm almost always open!
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_1_StoreOwner_NPC	Text	Welcome to Gorim's Emporium!
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_2_Any_WRITTEN	Text	Are you Gorim?
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_3_Any_WRITTEN	Text	What do you sell?
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_4_Any_WRITTEN	Text	Can we see your wares?
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_5_Any_Default	Text	Are you Gorim?
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_6_StoreOwner_NPC	Text	That's me! The one and only.
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_7_Any_Default	Text	What do you have to sell?
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_8_StoreOwner_NPC	Text	Everything you'll need for going out there into the Badlands…
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_9_StoreOwner_NPC	Text	…food, ropes, torches - and of course, armor and weapons.
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_10_StoreOwner_NPC	Text	I also have some other stock, like remedies and antitoxins. 
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_11_StoreOwner_NPC	Text	They might come in handy. Ever heard of deep spiders?
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_1_Bartender_NPC	Text	Hello, adventurers!
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_2_Bartender_NPC	Text	What can I offer you?
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_3_Any_WRITTEN	Text	Tell us about this place.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_4_Any_WRITTEN	Text	Your beer tastes bad.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_5_Any_WRITTEN	Text	We need a room.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_5_1_Any_WRITTEN	Text	Goodbye.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_5_1_Any	Text	We should go.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_6_Any_Default	Text	Tell us about your tavern.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_7_Bartender_NPC	Text	The inn? Well, it's not that old, but somehow it feels like it's been here forever.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_8_Bartender_NPC	Text	You can meet all kinds of people here, that's the good thing.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_9_Bartender_NPC	Text	An old Scavenger, a diplomat from the Council, a knight, a lord, a beggar…
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_10_Bartender_NPC	Text	We also have rooms to rent by the night.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_10_1_Any_Default	Text	Why the name - Gravekeep's Cask?
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_10_2_Bartender_NPC	Text	It's very old, from Imperial times. Perhaps a historian would know, but I don't.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_11_Any_Default	Text	Your beer is terrible, and that's being polite about it.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_12_Bartender_NPC	Text	What? I've never had any complaints about the beer before!
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_13_Bartender_NPC	Text	Maybe your palate is not refined enough.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_14_Any_Default	Text	We'd like to stay for the night.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_15_Bartender_NPC	Text	Sure! Just walk up to the suite and settle in.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_16_Any_Default	Text	A suite? 
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_17_Bartender_NPC	Text	It's more like a large bedroom, really - but you know, this is the capital city.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_NoMoneyToPay	Text	No money, eh. No room, then. 
Narration/&Scavengers_Generic_Hello	Text	Clear skies, my friends.
Narration/&Scavengers_Generic_Goodbye	Text	Stay in the light, my friends.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_1_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Deputies? A word, if you please.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_2_Joker_Default	Text	So famous already? I love it!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_3_Any_Default	Text	You were in there, too. Are you a member of the Council?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_4_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	I'm Annie Bagmordah, Quartermaster of the Scavenger's guild.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_5_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	We don't have a seat in there, but…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_6_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	…they all know exploring the Badlands without us would be a bad idea.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_7_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	That's why you should stop by our headquarters downtown.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_8_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	You'll need our services, I'm sure.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_9_Any_Default	Text	Is that… compulsory?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_10_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	No, but you'll find our services useful. Everyone does.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_11_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Did lord Carran not tell you?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_12_Any_Default	Text	No - he pretty much stuck to giving orders.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_13_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Ah, right. Anyway, we offer plenty of help and advice to beginners like you.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_14_Joker_Default	Text	We are grown-ups, you know. At least, most of us are.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_15_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Of course you are. Well, good luck!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_16_Lowlife_Default	Text	At least she's not another lady or something.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_17_Lawkeeper_Default	Text	Scavengers, eh? I never knew if they were legit or not.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_18_Sellsword_Default	Text	They're tough, these Scavengers. Fearless.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_19_Highclass_Default	Text	Inviting beggars to the Council? How peculiar.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_20_Acolyte_Default	Text	I'd rather visit the temple, honestly.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_21_Nosy_Default	Text	The Scavengers! They've seen so much already - the first explorers of the ancient empire!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_22_Authority_Default	Text	So what do you think? Should we check out their headquarters? 
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_23_Pragmatism_Default	Text	It's not far, but…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_24_Violence_Default	Text	I've had enough talking - let's go kill some monsters!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_25_Greed_Default	Text	If there's business to be done, we can't afford not to!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_1_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Ah - you came!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_2_Any_Default	Text	You piqued our curiosity. So - what exactly do you have to offer?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_3_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	You don't know? Tsk.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_4_Pragmatic_WRITTEN	Text	What help do you offer?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_5_NosyAuthority_WRITTEN	Text	Do you know Arwin Merton?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_6_Selfpres_WRITTEN	Text	Do you sell healing potions?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_6_Default_WRITTEN	Text	See you later.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_7_Pragmatic_Default	Text	What kind of help do you offer to people like us?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_8_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Simple. Now, people like you typically carry out missions for the Council…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_9_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	…in the Marches, even the Badlands. Sometimes far away, like Captain Merran.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_10_NosyAuthority_Default	Text	Who's Captain Merran?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_11_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	You really must be new. She's one of yours: Senior Deputy of the Council.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_12_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Anyway - you trek out to some old ruin in the Badlands, kill a bunch of orcs…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_13_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	…well, you're still a bit green, so let's say goblins.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_14_Joker_Default	Text	Ouch! You're hurting our feelings!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_15_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Orcs will hurt more than your feelings, believe me.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_16_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	And stop interrupting! It's rude.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_17_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	So let's say you find yourself with a whole load of rusty swords, leather armor, shields…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_18_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	…too much for you to lug back here.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_19_Joker_Default	Text	Oh - so we're puny as well as green? Thanks so much!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_20_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	So instead, you brave heroes just clear the place of monsters and draw us a nice, clean map.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_21_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Then we take our carts and pick up every piece of junk…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_22_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	…we bring it back, we sell it, and we split the profits with you.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_23_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	We move the stuff, you go off to kill more bad things, everybody wins.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_24_Joker_Default	Text	For a percentage, of course.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_25_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	What? You could never carry it all, anyway.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_26_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Not in your little backpacks.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_27_NosyAuthority_Default	Text	Do you know Arwin Merton, the so-called First Scavenger?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_28_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Of course.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_29_NosyAuthority_Default	Text	That's it?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_30_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Merton… it's a painful topic for me. 
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_31_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	I'd rather not talk about him.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_32_Friendly_Default	Text	Fair enough.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_33_Selfpres_Default	Text	Do you sell healing potions?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_34_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	No, we don't. There's a shop for that.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_35_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	However…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_36_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	We've got something even better.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_37_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Say one of you gets killed out there in the Badlands.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_38_Joker_Default	Text	Here we go again…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_39_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Normally, you'd have to come back in a hurry to get them raised.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_40_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Instead, you tell us about your misfortune, and we'll go get your friend's body.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_41_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	We take it to a cleric we know, and praise be! He raises your friend from the dead.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_42_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	It's a flat fee, and very reasonably priced.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_43_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Not a comfortable subject, I know. Perish the thought and so on - but it happens.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_44_Greed_Default	Text	That's not cheap, I'm sure.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_45_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Well… it's risky, and clerics need pretty gemstones for these spells… but can you really put a price on peace of mind?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_46_Authority_Default	Text	Well, thank you. I guess that's it for us.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_47_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Fine. Feel free to visit us anytime. Or drop into any Scavenger camp.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_48_Nosy_Authority_Default	Text	Are there others?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_49_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Anywhere we can settle. 
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_50_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	By the way, if you find Captain Henrik, tell him we're still interested.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_51_Authority_Default	Text	In what?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_52_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	In getting our people to Caer Lem.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_53_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	The outpost is perfect for us. Close to the Badlands, with plenty of space for our camp.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_54_Authority_Default	Text	Right, we'll tell him if we find him.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_55_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	That would be appreciated. 
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_56_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	The more you do for us, the more we do for you.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_57_Greed_Default	Text	Oh? So this… business relationship can get better?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_58_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	And I hope it will, friend.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_59_Any_Default	Text	I guess we'll see you around, then.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_60_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Sure. Good luck out there, and don't forget - in the Badlands, always keep your eyes open.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival1_Starter_Noflag	Text	So that's Caer Lem?
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival2_Partner_Noflag	Text	We're almost there… it's just up the hill.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival3_SelfPres_Noflag	Text	It's a little too quiet, don't you think?
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival4_Pragmatism_Slang	Text	We're in the Marches, so quiet can't be trusted.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival5_SelfPres_Normal	Text	True. Let's keep our eyes open.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival6_SelfPres_Formal	Text	Quite so. We must be on our guard.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival7_Authority_Normal	Text	Eyes up and hands on hilts, people. These are the Marches.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival8_Authority_Formal	Text	Hold formation, all! The Marches are full of perils.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival9_Selfish_Cynical_Normal	Text	Who put you in charge?
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival10_Selfish_Cynical_Slang	Text	Don't play the captain with me.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival11_Authority_Normal	Text	I'm just saying, be ready for anything.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival12_Authority_Formal	Text	Simply a suggestion. I meant no offense.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival13_Default_Slang	Text	Damn right. Let's get on with it.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival14_Default_Normal	Text	All right. Let's just keep going.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival15_Default_Formal	Text	Agreed. We should press on.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance16_Default_Noflag	Text	I have a bad feeling about this.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance17_Partner_Slang	Text	Where's the garrison? Dead or run away?
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance18_Partner_Normal	Text	There's no one here. Not even corpses.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance19_Default_Noflag	Text	Look! That tower… that's insane!
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance20_NOSY_Noflag	Text	Amazing! Classic Tirmarian architecture… I read about that, you know.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance21_NOSY_Noflag	Text	It just ended up here after the Cataclysm… incredible!
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance22_LUKEWARM_Slang	Text	Courtesy of the Cataclysm.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance23_LUKEWARM_Slang	Text	The Marches are full of stuff like this. The Badlands are worse.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance24_Cynic_Normal	Text	I never saw a tower just stuck in a mountain like that.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance25_Default_Normal	Text	We're not in the Badlands yet, but that's a good introduction.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance26_Authority_law_Noflag	Text	Anyway, we have a mission. Let's check the fortifications.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield1_Cynical_Formal	Text	Well, that's not a good sign.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield2_Cynical_Normal	Text	Does this tell us anything we don't already know?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield3_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	The blood isn't that fresh, but even vultures would have left some bones behind.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield4_Pragmatic_Formal	Text	There's enough blood here to suggest that the whole garrison was massacred.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield5_Any_Normal	Text	Maybe it was the goblins… they took the soldiers and… ate them?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield6_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	Those goblins were only a handful… A fifty-strong garrison would have made mincemeat of them.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield7_Any_Normal	Text	Well then, I'm out of ideas. Let's keep looking around.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside27_Pragmatism_Noflag	Text	There's definitely been fighting here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside28_cynicWISECRACKER_Noflag	Text	Why did we take this job again? Oh, yeah… these lovely Council badges.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside29_cynicWISECRACKER_Formal	Text	No one here to greet us? How rude! I was hoping for drinks, at least.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside30_Authority_React	Text	This is no time for jokes.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside31_Selfpres_Noflag	Text	Right. Whoever did this could still be around, and we don't want them hearing us.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside32_Helpful_Noflag	Text	We should look for survivors. Fifty people can't just vanish.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem33_Starter_Normal	Text	Did you see that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem34_Starter_Slang	Text	What the heck was that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem35_Partner_Default	Text	Someone's hiding inside the tower.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem36_Self_Pres_Default	Text	It's a trap! The goblins killed everyone, and now it's our turn!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem37_Helpful_Default	Text	Or they're the survivors, and they're being cautious.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem38_Pragmatism_Default	Text	We need to get up to that door.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem39_Selfpres_Default	Text	That won't be easy. These walls are falling apart.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem40_Violence_Default	Text	If they slaughtered the garrison, they'll pay!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem41_Beryl_NPC	Text	Back off! No closer!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem42_Starter_Default	Text	Who's there?
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem43_Robar_NPC	Text	We're not letting you in!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem44_Beryl_NPC	Text	And we're not coming out!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem47_Starter_Default	Text	Is Captain Henrik there? We need to talk to him!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem48_Beryl_NPC	Text	Don't you dare speak his name, you filthy bastard!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem49_Robar_NPC	Text	Don't talk to them!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem50_Lisbath_NPC	Text	They'll cast a spell on you!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem51_Beryl_NPC	Text	Don't touch me!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem52_Pragmatism_Normal	Text	Is something not right in there, or is it just me?
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem53_Pragmatism_Slang	Text	Lost their minds, the lot of 'em.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem54_Pragmatism_Formal	Text	Clearly their distressing experience has affected their reason.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem55_Joker_Normal	Text	Filthy bastard'. Should we write that down in our report?
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem56_Joker_Slang	Text	That's our report, then: they've all gone crazy. Mystery solved.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego78_Practical_Default	Text	Let's get to the door. Maybe if they can see us up close… 
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego79_Practical_Default	Text	…we can show them our Council badges.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego1_Robar_NPC	Text	They're here!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego2_Beryl_NPC	Text	You damn Soraks!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego3_Starter_Default	Text	Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego4_Partner_Default	Text	Did they say Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego5_Starter_Slang	Text	Ooh, they spotted it… we're shapeshifters from another world! Guess we'll have to go home now.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego6_Starter_Normal	Text	You can't be serious! Soraks are a legend for scaring children. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego7_Beryl_NPC	Text	You bastards took the Captain, but you won't take us!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego8_Robar_NPC	Text	Don't talk to them!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego9_Choice_1_WRITTEN	Text	We're Council deputies!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego10_Choice_2_WRITTEN	Text	Use spy call phrase
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego11_Choice_3_WRITTEN	Text	Use sellsword experience
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego12_Choice_4_WRITTEN	Text	Be reasonable!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego13_Authority_Normal	Text	We're deputies of the Council, sent by Protector Leira Kean!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego14_Beryl_FailedCheck	Text	Nice to meet you… I'm Princess Ceiwad. Get lost!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego15_Lisbath_FailedCheck	Text	Open the damn door, there are only four of them.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego16_Robar_SuccessCheck	Text	They have Council badges.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego17_Beryl_SuccessCheck	Text	Sure. Of course they do! Looted from whose corpses?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego18_Spy_Default	Text	So, sleeping in the beds of the Manacalon, are you?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego19_Beryl_NPC	Text	What?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego20_Defaulter_Default	Text	What was that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego21_Spy_Default	Text	Just fishing. Give it a moment.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego22_Darik_NPC	Text	Magic pillows give us sweet dreams.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego24_Sellsword_Default	Text	I know how you feel… I fought at Sandreed. Lost a lot of good friends there.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego25_Robar_NPC	Text	Sandreed, eh? Which unit?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego26_Beryl_NPC	Text	What happened to "don't talk to them"?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego27_Sellsword_Default	Text	The Longswords, under Lord Dalmore.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego28_Sellsword_Default	Text	He died on the third day… arrow in the eye. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego29_Sellsword_Default	Text	Jonas Mills was the real leader… fought to the bitter end.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego30_Robar_NPC	Text	Open up… they're not Soraks.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego31_Defaulter_Default	Text	Be reasonable and open the door. We're friendlies!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego32_Beryl_NPC	Text	Exactly what a Sorak would say.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego33_Defaulter_Default	Text	Come on! There are just four of us… Point crossbows at us if you like.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego34_Lisbath_NPC	Text	Let's do that! People… crossbows at the ready.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego35_Robar_NPC	Text	Fine with me. Daliat, open the door.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego36_Beryl_NPC	Text	No! I said no!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego37_Robar_NPC	Text	Close the door.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego38_Starter_Default	Text	Thank you for letting us in.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego39_Beryl_NPC	Text	Don't thank me.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego40_Starter_WRITTEN	Text	Are you the officer?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego43_CynicPrag_WRITTEN	Text	You thought we were Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego58_Starter_WRITTEN	Text	Can we talk to the others?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego40_Starter_Default	Text	Are you in charge here?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego41_Beryl_NPC	Text	Lieutenant Beryl Stonebeard.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego42_Beryl_NPC	Text	Second in command… After Captain Henrik.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego43_CynicPrag_Default	Text	So, you really believe you were attacked by Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego44_Beryl_NPC	Text	Man-sized lizards that can speak? 
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego45_Beryl_NPC	Text	Oh, yeah… they're real.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego46_Starter_NPC	Text	But we found no corpses… nothing.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego47_Beryl_NPC	Text	We know. They took all the bodies, ours and theirs.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego48_Beryl_NPC	Text	So no one can prove they exist.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego49_Pragmatic_WRITTEN	Text	That's awkward.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego50_Pragmatic_WRITTEN	Text	That's hard to believe.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego51_Pragmatic_WRITTEN	Text	That's garbage.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego49_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	No proof… that's kind of awkward.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego50_Pragmatic_Formal	Text	You realize, of course, how improbable that sounds?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego51_Pragmatic_Slang	Text	Course they did… just to make you look crazy.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego52_Beryl_NPC	Text	You won't laugh when they come back.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego53_Default_Default	Text	We got here without trouble.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego54_Beryl_NPC	Text	Then they let you in… and now you're trapped with us.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego55_Starter_Default	Text	Why would they do that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego56_Beryl_NPC	Text	How should I know? They're Soraks!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego57_Starter_Slang	Text	Mind if we talk to your buddies?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego58_Starter_Formal	Text	Might we have a little chat with your comrades in arms?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego59_Starter_Normal	Text	We'd like to talk to everyone here, if that's all right?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego60_Beryl_NPC	Text	As long as you don't try anything clever, we're good.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik1_Spy_Default	Text	I might have a better chance with this guy… alone.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik2_SelfpresLawful_Default	Text	I don't like being kept in the dark.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik3_Spy_Default	Text	I used to work in an embassy. Learned a few tricks.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik4_Starter_Default	Text	He doesn't strike me as the diplomatic type.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik5_Mean_Default	Text	He looks like any other beggar.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik6_Spy_Default	Text	Come on, trust me.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik7_Nosy_Default	Text	What exactly is it between you and him?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik8_Einar_Default	Text	We trust you to do what's best for us all.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik9_Pakri_Default	Text	Pakri watches. Don't betray her trust.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik10_Spy_Default	Text	Leave the goddess out of this, will you?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik11_Defaulter_Default	Text	If you do then, please, be our guest.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik12_Spy_NPC	Text	I saw a Whisperer's code carved in the door.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik13_Darik_NPC	Text	How do you know the code?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik14_Spy_Default	Text	I used to work for Delanim, at the embassy near the New Empire border.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik15_Darik_NPC	Text	I see. I'm supposed to kill anyone who knows those words and isn't a Whisperer.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik16_Spy_Default	Text	I'd appreciate if you didn't kill me, though.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik17_Darik_NPC	Text	We'll see.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik18_Spy_Default	Text	So, just to be sure, is any of this part of your business, or… 
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik19_Darik_NPC	Text	Wiping out a whole garrison just to get myself trapped with this bunch? No, that wasn't my plan.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik20_Spy_Default	Text	So… Soraks? Really?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik21_Darik_NPC	Text	What can I tell you? They looked just like the stories say.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik22_Darik_NPC	Text	The Captain betrayed us… they knew everything about our security.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik23_Darik_NPC	Text	Even hiding their bodies is in the stories.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik24_Starter_Default	Text	Think they're still around?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik25_Darik_NPC	Text	Possibly.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik26_Spy_Default	Text	Any idea what they're after?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik27_Darik_NPC	Text	No.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik28_Spy_Default	Text	Right. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik29_Spy_Default	Text	They'll want to talk to you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik30_Darik_NPC	Text	Fine.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik31_Spy_Default	Text	He's all yours.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik32_Starter_Default	Text	So who are you, friend?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik33_Darik_NPC	Text	Daliat Sunbird, scout.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik34_Starter_Default	Text	Do you believe they were Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik35_Darik_NPC	Text	Dunno. Seemed real, though.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik36_Starter_Default	Text	What do you think they wanted? 
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik37_Darik_NPC	Text	To kill us all.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik38_Any_Normal	Text	Not big on talk, eh?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik39_Any_Formal	Text	You seem a very reluctant conversationalist.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik40_Darik_NPC	Text	I'm gonna rest now.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik40_Alternate_Darik_NPC	Text	I'm having a pretty bad day, so if you'll excuse me…
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik41_AnySelfpres_NPC	Text	Is it me, or didn't he like that last question?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik42_Cynical_NPC	Text	Nice man.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik43_Starter_Default	Text	How about you? Did you learn anything?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik44_Spy_Default	Text	Not much. He thinks the Soraks are real, too.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik45_Partner_Default	Text	So much for your secret code.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik46_Spy_Default	Text	Sorry to disappoint.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath1_Lisbath_NPC	Text	Now it's my turn, right?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath2_Starter_Default	Text	What do you mean?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath3_Lisbath_NPC	Text	What is this? A murder investigation?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath4_Cynical_WRITTEN	Text	Should it be?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath5_Defaulter_WRITTEN	Text	Just trying to help.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath6_Authority_WRITTEN	Text	Anything we should know?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath7_Cynical_Default	Text	Should we be investigating?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath7_Lisbath_NPC	Text	Maybe. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath8_Authority_Formal	Text	You've said too much to stop now. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath9_Authority_Normal	Text	Speak up, then. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath10_Lisbath_NPC	Text	Well, let's say this all happened after a certain expedition. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath11_Any_Normal	Text	Go on.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath12_Any_Slang	Text	Spit it out.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath13_Any_Formal	Text	Speak up without fear, friend.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath14_Lisbath_NPC	Text	The scouts. They came back from a raid into the Badlands. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath15_Lisbath_NPC	Text	Found a ruin, came back with loot. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath16_Lisbath_NPC	Text	The next day, this happens. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath17_Lisbath_NPC	Text	Coincidence? You tell me. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath18_Any_Default	Text	The scouts, you say?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath19_Lisbath_NPC	Text	Only one of them's still alive.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath20_Lisbath_NPC	Text	Daliat.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath21_Any_Default	Text	Right.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath22_Defaulter_Default	Text	We just want to help.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath23_Lisbath_NPC	Text	Good luck with that.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath24_Authority_Default	Text	You sound worried. Anything we should know?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath25_Lisbath_NPC	Text	Get lost!
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath26_Defaulter_WRITTEN	Text	Sorry.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath27_Insight_WRITTEN	Text	You're hiding something.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath28_Authority_WRITTEN	Text	I don't like your tone.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath29_Mean_WRITTEN	Text	Go to hell.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath30_Defaulter_Default	Text	No offense intended.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath31_Insight_Default	Text	I'll take that as a yes. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath32_Authority_Default	Text	I don't like to be insulted.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath33_Mean_Default	Text	You go to hell, you spineless moron.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath34_Lisbath_NPC	Text	You should work on your manners, then. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath35_Lisbath_NPC	Text	And I don't like to be accused of… whatever. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath36_Defaulter_WRITTEN	Text	Never mind.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath37_Persuader_WRITTEN	Text	We started on the wrong foot.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath38_Intimidator_WRITTEN	Text	Speak up, or else!
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath39_Deceiver_WRITTEN	Text	We know there's a traitor.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath40_Defaulter_Default	Text	Get lost.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath41_Persuader_Default	Text	Can we start this over?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath42_Lisbath_Success	Text	Listen. Something's not right.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath43_Lisbath_Failure	Text	I don't think so.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath44_Intimidator_Default	Text	You'll tell me sooner or later. Later's more painful.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath45_Lisbath_NPC	Text	Friends, right?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath46_Lisbath_NPC	Text	Bring it on.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath47_Deceiver_Default	Text	We know there's a traitor among you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath48_Deceiver_Default	Text	Help us, and we'll help you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath49_Lisbath_Success	Text	I… I knew it. It's Daliat, right?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath50_Lisbath_NPC	Text	Shh! He's looking at us!
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath51_Lisbath_NPC	Text	I'll tell you what.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath52_Lisbath_Failure	Text	You think you can fool me that easily?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath53_Lisbath_NPC	Text	I don't buy it.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath55_AsAYes	Text	You must have a hearing problem, then.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar1_Starter_Default	Text	Hey, there.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_Starter_Formal	Text	Greetings, soldier.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar3_Robar_NPC	Text	Aye.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar4_Robar_NPC	Text	Name's Robar Sharp.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar5_Starter_Normal	Text	Sounds like you're the most experienced here, Robar.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar6_Starter_Formal	Text	I gather you are a veteran of long standing?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar7_Starter_Slang	Text	So you're the old sweat of the group, huh?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar8_Robar_NPC	Text	Yeah. But I'm not in charge, mind you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar9_Starter_Default	Text	Tell us about Stonebeard.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar10_Partner_Default	Text	Tell us about Daliat.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar11_Commentator_Default	Text	Tell us about Lisbath.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar11_Reactor_Default	Text	What should we do?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar12_Sellsword_Default	Text	Mercenary small talk
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar13_Partner_Default	Text	This Lieutenant Stonebeard… is she up to the job?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar14_Robar_NPC	Text	Clearly not. Look around.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar15_Robar_NPC	Text	Losing the captain broke her.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar16_Partner_Default	Text	What do you think of Daliat?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar17_Robar_NPC	Text	Never liked him. He's hiding something.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar18_Robar_NPC	Text	He's been nervous since we came back from the Badlands.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar19_Robar_NPC	Text	But it'd be no good picking a fight with him now… 
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar20_Starter_Formal	Text	Very wise.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar21_Starter_Normal	Text	I understand.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar22_Commentator_Default	Text	How about Lisbath? You're her superior?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar23_Robar_NPC	Text	Good woman. Strong, brave.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar24_Robar_NPC	Text	You can trust her with a sword… 
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar25_Robar_NPC	Text	…that's worth something in my book.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar26_Sellsword_Default	Text	So you fought at Sandreed too?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar27_Robar_NPC	Text	Oh, yeah. Got the scars from rebel arrows to prove it.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar28_Sellsword_NPC	Text	Oh, those damned skirmishers! They gave me a few holes, too.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar29_Sellsword_Default	Text	Well, if we survived Sandreed, we'll both make it through this.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar30_Robar_NPC	Text	That's the plan.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar31_Starter_Default	Text	So what do you think we should do?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar31_Robar_NPC	Text	For starters, not wait in here for the Soraks to come back and off us.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar32_Sellsword_Default	Text	But Stonebeard says stay, and she's an officer, so… ?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar33_Sellsword_Default	Text	Yeah. She's a stubborn one, and mutiny's a bad look on a soldier.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar34_Robar_NPC	Text	You could talk to her, deputy of the Council and all.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar35_Sellsword_Default	Text	So if we find a way, you're with us?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar36_Starter_Default	Text	I'm with myself. But don't let that stop you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal1_Authority_Normal	Text	Right… we need to make a decision here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal2_Authority_Formal	Text	It's clear that something must be done.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal3_Einar_Normal	Text	The Soraks are real? It's a lot to take in.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal4_Einar_Formal	Text	I'm shocked by the thought that Soraks might be real.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal5_Mean_Slang	Text	They're either crazy or stupid… no use to us in either case.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal6_Cynical_Normal	Text	We have enough to make our report to the Council, so let's get going.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal7_Cynical_Formal	Text	They can't help themselves or anyone else. We should return to Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal8_Cynical_Slang	Text	Let 'em rot. We're supposed to bring back Henrik, not them. 
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal9_Helpful_Normal	Text	If we don't help them, they'll either die or kill each other.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal10_Violent_Normal	Text	Let them. Could be fun to watch.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal11_Selpres_Normal	Text	This place is a death trap, we should get out while we can.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal12_Defaulter_Normal	Text	So everyone has an opinion… but what are we going to do?
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal13_Defaulter_Normal	Text	And what about Daliat? We got some pretty worrying hints about him.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal14_Defaulter_Normal	Text	What if he really is hiding something important?
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal15_Authority_WRITTEN	Text	We confront him.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal16_Violent_WRITTEN	Text	He might be a traitor.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal17_Default_WRITTEN	Text	It's just gossip.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal18_Selfpres_WRITTEN	Text	Let's not risk a fight.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal19_Authority_Normal	Text	We need to talk to him, find out the truth.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal20_Violent_Answer	Text	If he's a traitor, we can't look the other way.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal21_Default_Answer	Text	It's just paranoia, or personal grudges.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal22_Selfpres_Answer	Text	If we accuse him, it might end in blood.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal23_Default_Answer	Text	That leaves us with the others. What's our strategy?
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal24_Autority_WRITTEN	Text	We take the lead.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal25_Selpres_WRITTEN	Text	We get out of here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal26_Default_WRITTEN	Text	Let's talk to them all together.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal27_Cynicsm_WRITTEN	Text	We push Sharp to mutiny.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal28_Authority_Answer	Text	We tell Stonebeard we're in charge, and take them home.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal29_Selpres_Answer	Text	We get the hell out of here. They can either follow or stay here to die.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal30_Default_Answer	Text	Let's just get them together and discuss this.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal31_Cynicsm_Answer	Text	We tell Sharp to challenge Stonebeard, with our support.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal32_Any_Reaction	Text	All right.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal33_Any_Reaction	Text	I'm not sure, but… fine.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal34_Any_Reaction	Text	Agreed.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal35_Any_Reaction	Text	I don't think that's a good idea.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal36_Any_Reaction	Text	We can't do that.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik201_Starter_Default	Text	We need to talk.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik202_Darik_NPC	Text	Do we?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik2_Choice1_WRITTEN	Text	Not now.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik2_Choice2_WRITTEN	Text	You were with an expedition recently.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik2_Choice2_bailout	Text	Well… maybe later.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik203_Starter_Formal	Text	Word is you took part in an expedition to the Badlands.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik204_Starter_Normal	Text	About this trip to the Badlands.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik205_Darik_NPC	Text	That's what we do, here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik206_Starter_Default	Text	The Soraks attacked after you came back.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik207_Darik_NPC	Text	So what - I brought them here?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik208_Whisperer_Default	Text	Listen, colleague… you can trust me.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik209_Darik_NPC	Text	You, maybe… but the others? 
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik210_Starter_Default	Text	Did you bring something back?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik211_Darik_NPC	Text	We always do, like the Scavengers.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik212_Darik_NPC	Text	Ask Sharp, he has tons of things brought back from there.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik213_Starter_Default	Text	But maybe this time, you took something special.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik214_Darik_NPC	Text	It's nothing of value to Soraks!
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik215_Starter_Default	Text	How would you know?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik216_Whisperer_Default	Text	Show me, colleague.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik217_Persuader_Default	Text	Just trust us.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik218_Intimidate_Default	Text	We could simply take it.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik219_Deceiver_Default	Text	We can pay for it.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik220_Defaulter_Default	Text	We're not blaming you, but we need to know.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik221_Darik_NPC	Text	It's just an old book… might be of historical value.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik222_Darik_NPC	Text	Take it, then. And find a way to get us out of here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik223_Deceiver_Default	Text	The Council will reward you if you help us.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik224_Darik_NPC	Text	You won't buy me with words.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik225_Intimidate_Default	Text	Show us, or we'll help ourselves.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik226_Darik_NPC	Text	I don't think so.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik227_Darik_NPC	Text	No.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik228_Persuade	Text	Trust us. We're all on the same side here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik229_Default_NPC	Text	We just need to know.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik230_Darik_NPC	Text	Hey, what's that? Hey!
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_0_Salutations	Text	Hey, there!
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_1_Salutations	Text	Deputies.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_Choice1_WRITTEN	Text	Never mind.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_Choice2_WRITTEN	Text	We want you to take the lead.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_Choice1_Bailout	Text	Never mind. We'll come back later.
Narration/&CaerLem_End6_Robar_NPC	Text	Aye.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar21_Authority_Normal	Text	Robar, we want you to take over from Beryl.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar22_Robar_NPC	Text	She'll refuse.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar23_Authority_Normal	Text	We'll back you up. She won't have a choice.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar24_Robar_Refuse_NPC	Text	No can do… it won't work.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar25_Robar_Refuse_NPC	Text	Right, but you deal with her if she gets mad.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar26_Beryl_NPC	Text	What's that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar27_Authority_Normal	Text	We believe Robar should assume command of your… remaining garrison.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar28_Beryl_NPC	Text	Him? Just like that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar29_Authority_Normal	Text	We order it, as deputies of the Council.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar210_Lisbath_NPC	Text	Bullshit.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar211_Robar_NPC	Text	Told ya.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar212_Authority_Normal	Text	Step down, Lieutenant, that's an order.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar213_Beryl_NPC	Text	In your dreams!
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar214_Beryl_NPC	Text	He'll get you killed.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar215_Cynic_Normal	Text	She took that well.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar216_Any_Normal	Text	So boss, what's the plan?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar217_Any_Formal	Text	Right then, what do you say, officer?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar218_Robar_NPC	Text	What the… ?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar219_Robar_LisbathAttacked	Text	Lisbath!
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar220_Robar_BerylAttacked	Text	Lieutenant!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl21_Authority_Default	Text	Can we talk?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl22_Beryl_NPC	Text	What now?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice1_WRITTEN	Text	We'll come back later.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice2_WRITTEN	Text	You should step down.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice1_bailout	Text	Sorry, we'll come back later.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice1_beryl	Text	You do that.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl23_Authority_Default	Text	You need to step down.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl24_Beryl_NPC	Text	Oh? And why is that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl25_Authority_Normal	Text	This command… this situation… is clearly too much for you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl26_Authority_Formal	Text	Without wishing to cause offense, you simply lack the experience this situation requires.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl27_Authority_Slang	Text	Because you're no damn use… that's why!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl28_Persuasion_NPC	Text	You think I'm happy to be in charge of this mess?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl29_Intimidation_WRITTEN	Text	We are taking command.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl210_Persuasion_WRITTEN	Text	Robar should lead.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl211_Highclass_WRITTEN	Text	Your ancestors would agree.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl212_Intimidation_Default	Text	We are relieving you of command, in the name of the Council.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl213_Beryl_NPC	Text	You… well… chain of command, I suppose.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl214_Beryl_NPC	Text	Fine… you get us out of this, deputies!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl215_Beryl_NPC	Text	Go boil your head!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl216_Persuasion_Default	Text	Robar Sharp will command in your stead.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl217_Beryl_NPC	Text	A former sellsword? There's a reason he's not an officer.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl218_Persuasion_Default	Text	He's capable enough.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl219_Sellsword_Default	Text	Mind your words.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl220_Highclass_Default	Text	Your noble ancestors wouldn't like you to die rotting in there.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl221_Beryl_NPC	Text	Maybe you're right.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl222_Beryl_NPC	Text	I can't believe you're doing this to me!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl223_Any_Formal	Text	How dare you?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl224_Any_Slang	Text	Go boil your head!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl225_Any_Normal	Text	I don't like your tone.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl226_Beryl_NPC	Text	Hey, what's that… ?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl227_Beryl_RobarAttacked	Text	Robar!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl226_Beryl_LisbathAttacked	Text	Lisbath!
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled1_Beryl_NPC	Text	You've got some explaining to do…
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled2_Starter_Default	Text	Daliat was hiding this from you.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled3_Authority_Formal	Text	We believe it may have attracted the Soraks.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled4_Authority_Normal	Text	That's probably why they attacked.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled5_Any_Default	Text	He refused to let it go, despite the danger.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled6_Robar_NPC	Text	I'm not surprised. 
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled7_Lisbath_NPC	Text	Me neither.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled8_Beryl_NPC	Text	That's it? So when it's your turn to be killed, I should just say that?
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled9_Robar_NPC	Text	Wait… what… ?
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled10_Robar_NPC	Text	Lisbath!
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled1_Lisbath_NPC	Text	Robar, no!
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled2_Beryl_NPC	Text	I'm sorry… 
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled3_Lisbath_NPC	Text	You… this is all your fault… 
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled4_Violence_Default	Text	Soldiers die. You should know that.
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled5_Maraike_Default	Text	Maraike will take his soul to peace.
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled6_Einar_Default	Text	Don't be fooled, the Soraks are responsible… 
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled7_Einar_Default	Text	…and many others will fall if we don't report to the Council.
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled8_Jugdmental_Default	Text	Don't you think it's time to stop bickering?
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled9_Lisbath_NPC	Text	You people - just leave me alone!
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled10_Beryl_NPC	Text	You can't do that! 
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo1_Selpfresprag_Default	Text	He came from here! Look!
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo2_Any_Default	Text	What's this? A secret passage?
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo3_Any_Default	Text	From Imperial times… 
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo4_Selpfresprag_Default	Text	That was just a scout… 
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo5_Selpfresprag_Default	Text	…more will be coming.
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo6_Default	Text	They're here!
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo7_Default	Text	They're coming back! Outside!
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo8_Selfpres_Prag_Default	Text	We need to go! Take your stuff.
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo9_Selfpres_Prag_Default	Text	Into the secret passage, before it's too late!
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled1_Robar_NPC	Text	Lisbath!
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled2_Beryl_NPC	Text	I'm sorry… 
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled3_Robar_NPC	Text	I should have… 
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled4_Sellsword_Default	Text	Stay with us, brother. We're not the enemy.
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled5_Robar_NPC	Text	Soraks… 
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled6_Beryl_NPC	Text	Right. Who's crazy now?
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled7_Einar_Default	Text	We must alert the Council!
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled8_Selfpres_Normal	Text	We need to get out of here, that's what we need!
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled9_Selfpres_Formal	Text	Surviving is what matters now.
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled10_Authority_Normal	Text	Look at that skin! It's unbelievable… 
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled1_Lisbath_NPC	Text	Oh, no… 
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled2_Robar_NPC	Text	You know she had it coming. She failed us.
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled3_JudgmentalAny_Default	Text	Happy now?
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled4_Robar_NPC	Text	We didn't do this… the… Sorak did.
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled5_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Right, then. They are real.
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled6_Einar_Default	Text	This is unbelievable! The Council must know!
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled7_Selfpres_Default	Text	And we need to leave, or we'll be next.
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled8_Jugdmental_Default	Text	This could have been avoided if you people hadn't wasted time bickering.
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled9_Logical_Default	Text	Let's focus here. We can't save her now, but we can still save ourselves.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel1_Starter_Default	Text	Seems quiet. 
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel2_Selfpres_Default	Text	We must be cautious. Other Soraks might be scouting these caves.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel3_Partner_Default	Text	Hey, where's Daliat?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel4_Starter_Default	Text	He was here a moment ago.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel5_Selfpres_Default	Text	The Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel6_Beryl_NPC	Text	Daliat always had his own secrets. 
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel7_Beryl_NPC	Text	I think he just went his own way.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel8_Starter_Default	Text	And the others are in the tower looking for that secret door. We don't have much choice… let's move!
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel1_Beryl_NPC	Text	Wait… 
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel1_Robar_NPC	Text	Wait… 
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel2_Starter_Normal	Text	Think they're Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel3_Starter_Formal	Text	Are those Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel4_Cynicism_Default	Text	Who else?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel5_Violence_Default	Text	We can surprise them.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel6_Selfpres_Default	Text	Can't we sneak around?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel7_Prag_Default	Text	From what I see, not a chance.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel8_Violence_Default	Text	All right. Tread lightly, and we all attack at once.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort1_Starter_Default	Text	What do you think?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort2_Stonecunning_Default	Text	Typical Manacalon architecture… 
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort3_Stonecunning_Default	Text	…the stonecutting is textbook… 
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort4_Stonecunning_Default	Text	…using this orange stone from the mountain.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort5_Starter_Default	Text	That's it? Orange stone?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort5_Starter_Formal	Text	Is that all? Stone?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort6_Stonecunning_Default	Text	I'm not answering that.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort6_Stonecunning_Formal	Text	I won't dignify that question with an answer.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort7_dunno	Text	Maybe a dwarf could tell you about stone.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort8_dunno	Text	I guess it's… good stone.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort9_dunno	Text	Well, that was enlightening.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter1_Starter_Normal	Text	What's this?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter2_Starter_Formal	Text	What is this thing?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter3_Arcane_Normal	Text	I think it was a Minor Gate.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter4_Arcane_Formal	Text	I believe this was called a minor Imperial Gate.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter5_Arcane_Default	Text	At its height, the Manacalon Empire had countless Gates like this.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter6_Arcane_Default	Text	To magically travel through the Empire.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter7_Partner_Default	Text	I don't suppose it still works?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter8_Arcane_Default	Text	Some say there are still functioning Gates.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter9_Commentator_Default	Text	And this plaque? Any value?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter10_Arcane_Default	Text	Maybe. The Tower of Knowledge? Why not?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse1_Starter_Default	Text	This one didn't die yesterday.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse2_Partner_Default	Text	What's this outfit?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse3_History_Default	Text	Tirmarian.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse4_Selfpres_Default	Text	Who wants to open this?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse5_Greed_Default	Text	You never know, there might be a fortune in there.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian1_Starter_Default	Text	Can anyone read that?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian2_History_Default	Text	It's old Tirmarian.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian3_History_Default	Text	It looks like part of an inquisitor's outfit.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian4_Partner_Default	Text	So that's from… the tower up there?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian5_Starter_Default	Text	Maybe we're inside the tower?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian6_Greed_Default	Text	Is that gold?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian7_History_Default	Text	This is history. History, all around us!
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian8_Prag_Default	Text	Take it and let's move! The Soraks don't care about history, I'm sure.
Narration/&CaerLem_End1_Starter_Default	Text	We're safe!
Narration/&CaerLem_End2_Partner_Default	Text	We still have to go back to Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&CaerLem_End3_Commentator_Default	Text	The road isn't far.
Narration/&CaerLem_End4_Starter_Normal	Text	We'll see you back there, all right? You'll be okay?
Narration/&CaerLem_End5_Starter_Formal	Text	I suppose we'll meet again in Caer Cyflen? Are you good to return by yourselves?
Narration/&CaerLem_End7_Beryl_NPC	Text	Of course.
Narration/&CaerLem_End8_Daliat_NPC	Text	Sure.
Narration/&CaerLem_End9_Lisbath_NPC	Text	Yeah.
Narration/&Council01_1_NPC_Carran	Text	Oh, here you are!
Narration/&Council01_2_NPC_Carran	Text	How was the mission?
Narration/&Council01_3_Any_Practical	Text	Successful.
Narration/&Council01_4_Any_Exalted	Text	You won't believe it!
Narration/&Council01_5_Any_Cynical	Text	We almost died!
Narration/&Council01_6_Any_ReligionEinar	Text	We must report to the Council immediately.
Narration/&Council01_7_Any_Greedy	Text	Not paid enough.
Narration/&Council01_8_Any_Seenitall	Text	Business as usual.
Narration/&Council01_9_Any_Violent	Text	Let's say we earned a few scars.
Narration/&Council01_10_NPC_follows3_Carran	Text	Good.
Narration/&Council01_11_NPC_follows4_Carran	Text	Let's hope the Council does, then!
Narration/&Council01_12_NPC_follows5_Carran	Text	Yes here you are, safe and sound.
Narration/&Council01_13_NPC_follows6_Carran	Text	Of course. I'll inform the Council that you've returned.
Narration/&Council01_14_NPC_follows7_Carran	Text	Who is?
Narration/&Council01_15_NPC_follows8_Carran	Text	I appreciate your professionalism.
Narration/&Council01_16_NPC_follows8_Carran	Text	There's no dishonor in a few scars.
Narration/&Council01_17_Any_Practical	Text	When can we hope for an audience?
Narration/&Council01_18_NPC_Carran	Text	It depends… tomorrow, if you're lucky. 
Narration/&Council01_19_NPC_Carran	Text	Another party came back yesterday… 
Narration/&Council01_20_NPC_Carran	Text	…and they still have to make their report, so… 
Narration/&Council01_21_NPC_Carran	Text	…maybe they'll see you both at once.
Narration/&Council01_22_Any_Practical	Text	We have urgent news!
Narration/&Council01_23_Any_Practical_Slang	Text	Listen, we can't wait around here! What we've got is big!
Narration/&Council01_24_Any_Practical	Text	The outpost at Caer Lem has been attacked!
Narration/&Council01_25_Any_Practical	Text	Almost all of the garrison was killed!
Narration/&Council01_26_NPC_Carran	Text	By all the gods!
Narration/&Council01_27_NPC_Carran	Text	Meet me in the Council chamber.
Narration/&Council01_28_NPC_Carran	Text	I'll inform my superiors.
Narration/&Council01_29_Any_ReligionEinar	Text	This cannot wait!
Narration/&Council01_30_Any_ReligionEinar	Text	The Caer Lem outpost was attacked by the Soraks!
Narration/&Council01_31_Any_ReligionEinar	Text	Almost all of the garrison was killed!
Narration/&Council01_32_NPC_Carran	Text	Soraks?
Narration/&Council01_33_NPC_Carran	Text	Is that a joke?
Narration/&Council01_34_Any_Other	Text	I'm afraid not. 
Narration/&Council01_35_Any_Other_slang	Text	We saw them… with our own eyes!
Narration/&Council01_36_NPC_Carran	Text	Well, if you want to bring that to the Council… 
Narration/&Council01_37_NPC_Carran	Text	…that's your decision.
Narration/&Council01_38_NPC_Carran	Text	If you're so eager to look like idiots… 
Narration/&Council01_39_NPC_Carran	Text	Meet me in the Council chamber.
Narration/&Council01_40_NPC_Speaker	Text	The Legacy Council is now in session.
Narration/&Council01_41_NPC_Speaker	Text	Captain Heather Merran has the floor.
Narration/&Council01_42_NPC_Ed_Morgan	Text	Ladies and gentlemen… your Royal Highness… 
Narration/&Council01_43_NPC_Ed_Morgan	Text	…my party and I have made a very worrying discovery.
Narration/&Council01_44_NPC_Ed_Morgan	Text	In the Badlands… 
Narration/&Council01_45_NPC_Ed_Morgan	Text	…near the place we call Black Hill… 
Narration/&Council01_46_NPC_Ed_Morgan	Text	…we saw a group that we took to be Scavengers.
Narration/&Council01_47_NPC_Ed_Morgan	Text	They attacked us right away… 
Narration/&Council01_48_NPC_Ed_Morgan	Text	…but we were able to fight them off.
Narration/&Council01_49_NPC_Ed_Morgan	Text	They were trying to get away with this.
Narration/&Council01_50_NPC_Antiquarian_Gormsdottir	Text	What is it?
Narration/&Council01_51_NPC_Ed_Morgan	Text	This box contains a gem… A ruby, it would appear.
Narration/&Council01_52_NPC_Ed_Morgan	Text	We have determined that it has magical properties… 
Narration/&Council01_53_NPC_Ed_Morgan	Text	…and we believe the Council should examine it.
Narration/&Council01_54_NPC_Danantar	Text	So we will, captain, but really… 
Narration/&Council01_55_NPC_Danantar	Text	…is that all? 
Narration/&Council01_56_NPC_Danantar	Text	You called an emergency meeting of the Council for a simple magical gem?
Narration/&Council01_57_NPC_Danantar	Text	Her Royal Highness has a busy schedule… 
Narration/&Council01_58_NPC_Princess	Text	Please, Lord Danantar, in this chamber I'm just a student of magic.
Narration/&Council01_59_NPC_Danantar	Text	Hear, hear!
Narration/&Council01_60_NPC_Danantar	Text	Anyway, Captain, the Council has a great deal of business… 
Narration/&Council01_61_NPC_Ed_Morgan	Text	They were Soraks, our attackers… not Scavengers, not bandits… Soraks!
Narration/&Council01_62_NPC_Danantar	Text	… 
Narration/&Council01_63_NPC_Antiquarian_Gormsdottir	Text	Soraks?
Narration/&Council01_64_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Text	Is this a joke?
Narration/&Council01_65_NPC_Einar	Text	The Sorr-Akkath are no laughing matter, Lord Faisech!
Narration/&Council01_66_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Text	Oh, you know what I mean.
Narration/&Council01_67_NPC_Princess	Text	What do you mean, my lord?
Narration/&Council01_68_NPC_Tower_Faisech_Faisech	Text	How many times has the Council heard tales of these so-called Soraks?
Narration/&Council01_69_NPC_Antiquarian_Gormsdottir	Text	At least twenty, I'd say.
Narration/&Council01_70_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze	Text	More. Twenty-three.
Narration/&Council01_71_NPC_Danantar	Text	More each year. It's becoming a fad.
Narration/&Council01_72_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Text	I'm sorry, Captain, but… you are certain that you encountered Soraks?
Narration/&Council01_73_PlayerChoice_Default	Text	We did, too!
Narration/&Council01_74_PlayerChoice_Exalted	Text	It's true! They're real!
Narration/&Council01_75_PlayerChoice_Authoritative	Text	If you doubt her word, you can trust ours! We fought Soraks ourselves!
Narration/&Council01_76_PlayerChoice_Practical	Text	She's telling the truth!
Narration/&Council01_77_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Text	What?
Narration/&Council01_78_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Text	And who might you be?
Narration/&Council01_79_NPC_LeiraKean	Text	Some new recruits, my lord. They were sworn in quite recently.
Narration/&Council01_80_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Text	New recruits, eh? They place too much stock in rumor, it seems.
Narration/&Council01_81_NPC_LeiraKean	Text	They assure me that they saw Soraks as well.
Narration/&Council01_82_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze	Text	Wait!
Narration/&Council01_83_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze	Text	Do you realize how serious this is?
Narration/&Council01_84_PlayerChoice_1_WRITTEN	Text	We do.
Narration/&Council01_85_PlayerChoice_2_WRITTEN	Text	We saw them.
Narration/&Council01_86_PlayerChoice_3_WRITTEN	Text	They attacked Caer Lem.
Narration/&Council01_84_PlayerChoice_1	Text	We do.
Narration/&Council01_85_PlayerChoice_2	Text	The Soraks are real! We saw them… we fought them!
Narration/&Council01_86_PlayerChoice_3	Text	They attacked the Caer Lem outpost… the garrison suffered severe losses!
Narration/&Council01_87_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_1	Text	We have never had two sightings reported at the same time.
Narration/&Council01_88_NPC_Tower_Faisech_1	Text	Pah! Does that make this nonsense more believable?
Narration/&Council01_89_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_2	Text	Two sightings - independent witnesses! When will you see the truth?
Narration/&Council01_90_NPC_Morgan_2	Text	Yes, sir!
Narration/&Council01_91_NPC_Morgan_2	Text	Reptilians… fast, strong… 
Narration/&Council01_92_PlayerSelection_Authoritative	Text	…they can climb on walls just like spiders!
Narration/&Council01_93_PlayerSelection_Default	Text	…they're tough, too!
Narration/&Council01_94_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_3	Text	Caer Lem? The outpost in the Marches? 
Narration/&Council01_95_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_3	Text	What do you mean by heavy losses?
Narration/&Council01_96_PlayerSelection_Authoritative	Text	The Soraks took over captain Henrik… 
Narration/&Council01_97_PlayerSelection_Authoritative	Text	…and only two of them are still alive.
Narration/&Council01_98_PlayerSelection_Authoritative	Text	They can testify, too.
Narration/&Council01_99_NPC_Gormsdottir	Text	Do you have any… material proof of their existence?
Narration/&Council01_100_PlayerSelection_Authoritative	Text	I beg your pardon?
Narration/&Council01_101_NPC_Morgan	Text	Like what?
Narration/&Council01_102_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Text	Well… A dead body, for example!
Narration/&Council01_103_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Text	Or even just a head?
Narration/&Council01_104_NPC_Einar	Text	If we go to Caer Lem, will we find the bodies of these Soraks?
Narration/&Council01_105_PlayerSelection_Authoritative	Text	Probably not.
Narration/&Council01_106_NPC_Morgan	Text	They took their dead with them when they retreated.
Narration/&Council01_107_PlayerSelection_Authoritative	Text	The bodies of their victims, too.
Narration/&Council01_108_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Text	Hm! How very convenient!
Narration/&Council01_109_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Text	So you can offer us no proof of this… 
Narration/&Council01_110_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Text	…adventurer's fable.
Narration/&Council01_111_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze	Text	And what if proof were to be brought before the Council?
Narration/&Council01_112_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Text	What proof? How? 
Narration/&Council01_113_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Text	If the Soraks take away their fallen, as they say.
Narration/&Council01_114_NPC_Danantar	Text	That's not our problem. Let them find a way.
Narration/&Council01_115_NPC_Arcaneum_Keenmind	Text	These are new recruits, correct?
Narration/&Council01_116_NPC_Arcaneum_Keenmind	Text	Then let this be their new mission:
Narration/&Council01_117_NPC_Arcaneum_Keenmind	Text	Bring us the head of a Sorak, for the whole Council to see.
Narration/&Council01_118_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze	Text	That would certainly be proof, Lord Faisech, would it not?
Narration/&Council01_119_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Text	Oh, very well. Meanwhile, the Council will examine the gem.
Narration/&Council01_120_NPC_Tower_Faisech	Text	If there is nothing else?
Narration/&Council01_121_NPC_Speaker	Text	Dean Iolair Faisech of the Tower of Knowledge calls for a recess!
Narration/&Council01_122_NPC_Speaker	Text	Does any member object?
Narration/&Council01_123_NPC_Speaker	Text	No? It is resolved, then! The Legacy Council is now in recess!
Narration/&Council01_124_NPC_Carran	Text	That actually went better than I expected.
Narration/&Council01_125_PlayerChoice_Cynical_WRITTEN	Text	Who's the grumpy dwarf?
Narration/&Council01_126_PlayerChoice_Einar_WRITTEN	Text	We had to stand by Merran.
Narration/&Council01_127_PlayerChoice_Nobility_WRITTEN	Text	The Princess is bland.
Narration/&Council01_128_PlayerChoice_Urchin_WRITTEN	Text	They are seat-warmers.
Narration/&Council01_125_PlayerChoice_Cynical	Text	Who's the grumpy dwarf woman?
Narration/&Council01_126_PlayerChoice_Einar	Text	We had to stand by Merran… We know she speaks the truth.
Narration/&Council01_127_PlayerChoice_Nobility	Text	I must say, the Princess was… not what I expected.
Narration/&Council01_128_PlayerChoice_Urchin	Text	They're just a bunch of politicking seat-warmers, for all their airs and graces.
Narration/&Council01_129_NPC_Carran	Text	Chancellor Hertha Gormsdottir, of the Guild of Antiquarians.
Narration/&Council01_130_NPC_Carran	Text	She's… Well, yes. Quite.
Narration/&Council01_131_NPC_Carran	Text	I'm sure she will appreciate your support.
Narration/&Council01_132_NPC_Carran	Text	Oh? And what did you expect, exactly?
Narration/&Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Cynical_WRITTEN	Text	Someone older.
Narration/&Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Highclass_WRITTEN	Text	Someone… a little more presentable?
Narration/&Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Authority_WRITTEN	Text	Someone more dignified.
Narration/&Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Cynical	Text	A pretty, empty-headed girl. Oh, wait… 
Narration/&Council01_134_NPC_Carran	Text	Mind your words! She may rank low on the Council… 
Narration/&Council01_135_NPC_Carran	Text	…but she is our sovereign, and she is well loved in the Principality.
Narration/&Council01_136_PlayerChoice_Authoritative	Text	A more… how to put it? A more commanding personality?
Narration/&Council01_137_NPC_Carran	Text	Ah, well… she is young still. And she has many other qualities.
Narration/&Council01_138_PlayerChoice_Nobility	Text	Someone more… regal?
Narration/&Council01_139_NPC_Carran	Text	No one is more regal than our Princess, believe me!
Narration/&Council01_140_Player_Nobility	Text	You know what I mean.
Narration/&Council01_141_NPC_Carran	Text	No, actually… I don't.
Narration/&Council01_142_PlayerChoice_Urchin	Text	A shower of weevils. Rich, clean weevils!
Narration/&Council01_143_NPC_Carran	Text	And your employers, let's not forget.
Narration/&Council01_144_NPC_Carran	Text	I must admit, the Legacy Council is a… complex body.
Narration/&Council01_145_NPC_Carran	Text	Anyway… 
Narration/&Council01_146_NPC_Carran	Text	…some people might want to talk to you after this.
Narration/&Council01_147_NPC_Carran	Text	Working for the Council, you are expected to be neutral.
Narration/&Council01_148_PlayerChoice_Default	Text	But?
Narration/&Council01_149_NPC_Carran	Text	But you have the right to have friends.
Narration/&Council01_150_NPC_Carran	Text	So feel free to talk to whoever you like.
Narration/&Council01_151_NPC_Carran	Text	As long your allegiance remains to the Council as a whole.
Narration/&Council01_152_PlayerChoice_Register_Formal	Text	You may rely on our honor.
Narration/&Council01_153_PlayerChoice_Register_normal	Text	Of course.
Narration/&Council01_154_PlayerChoice_Register_Slang	Text	All right, then.
Narration/&Council01_155_Merran_Thanks01	Text	Hey, deputies - thanks for the support in there!
Narration/&Council01_156_AnyFriendly	Text	You're welcome, Captain. 
Narration/&Council01_157_Merran_Thanks02	Text	So, those bastards got Henrik? Shame.
Narration/&Council01_158_Curious	Text	You knew him?
Narration/&Council01_159_Merran_Thanks03	Text	Yes, indeed. I wonder who'll volunteer to retake Caer Lem now...
Narration/&Council01_160_Friendly	Text	The Scavengers could lead the way.
Narration/&Council01_161_Merran_Thanks04	Text	Yeah. They'll find a bunch of hotheads to retake the fort, I'm sure.
Narration/&Council01_162_Merran_Thanks05	Text	Stay in the light, friends!
Narration/&Council01_163_Merran_AnyFriendly	Text	You, too!
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_1_Beryl_NPC	Text	Well, if it isn't our brave saviors.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_2_Any_Default	Text	Good day, Lieutenant.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_3_Aristocrat_Formal	Text	Salutations, Lieutenant.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_4_Beryl_NPC	Text	I'm no longer a lieutenant. I resigned my commission. I work for my people now.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_5_Any_Default	Text	The Snow Alliance?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_6_Beryl_NPC	Text	I will never step foot in the Badlands again.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_7_Any_Default	Text	I understand your reluctance.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_8_Loyalty_Normal	Text	Yes, well, you clearly weren't cut out for that posting.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_9_Beryl_NPC	Text	I've made my peace, but you aren't here to check on my welfare, are you?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_10_Any_Formal	Text	No, we seek information. Before the attack, where exactly did your scout venture?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_11_Any_Normal	Text	No, we have questions. Your scout? Do you know where he was before the attack? 
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_12_Beryl_NPC	Text	You mean Daliat?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_13_Any_Formal	Text	Yes, we'd like to know where he went before the Soraks attacked.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_14_Any_Normal	Text	Right, Daliat. Where did he go before the Soraks attacked?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_15_Beryl_NPC	Text	As far as I know, there's not a name for that place or a road that leads there…
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_16_Beryl_NPC	Text	But I can show you on a map. It's near the ruins of an ancient tower.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_17_Aristocrat_Formal	Text	You have our gratitude, Lady Stonebeard.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_18_Any_Default	Text	Thank you, Beryl. We appreciate the help.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_19_Beryl_NPC	Text	What are you thanking me for? Sending you to your death?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_1_Daliat_NPC	Text	Greetings, deputies.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_2_Spy_Normal	Text	Are you ready to come clean?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_3_Any_Default	Text	Greetings, Daliat. If that's even your name.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_4_Daliat_NPC	Text	Of course it's my name. What are you implying?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_5_Any_Default	Text	Nothing at all. We just want to establish who we're talking to.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_6_Daliat_NPC	Text	Daliat Sunbird, Scout of the Council. You know who I am!
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_7_Any_Default	Text	Then perhaps you can tell us the location of the ruin you came across right before the Soraks attacked.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_8_Daliat_NPC	Text	What do you mean?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_9_Spy_Normal	Text	Tell us all you know and perhaps we can convince the Council to go easy on you.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_10_Daliat_NPC	Text	Why would they need to go easy on me? I've told you all I know.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_11_Spy_Normal	Text	You haven't told us the location of the Manacalon ruin you found right before the Soraks attacked.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_12_Daliat_NPC	Text	I won't take you there…
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_13_Daliat_NPC	Text	But I can show you the location on a map.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_14_Daliat_NPC	Text	Of course, nothing is free.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_15_Any_Default	Text	Indeed. Thank you.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_16_Daliat_NPC	Text	I'm glad we could come to some agreement.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_17_Any_Default	Text	As are we.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_18_Daliat_NPC	Text	It's just business, after all.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_19_Any_Default	Text	Right, nothing personal. Take care, Daliat.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_1_Robar_NPC	Text	Well, look who it is. I see you survived the Council.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_2_Any_Default	Text	We did indeed.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_3_Sellsword_Normal	Text	Don't get your hopes up. We aren't here to offer you a job.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_4_Robar_NPC	Text	Good, because I imagine you'd probably pay very poorly.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_5_Sellsword_Normal	Text	You imagine correctly. I do have a question, though.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_6_Robar_NPC	Text	To what do I owe the honor?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_7_Any_Default	Text	We'd like to know where Daliat and his scouts ventured right before the attack.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_8_Robar_NPC	Text	Looking for Soraks, are we?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_9_Any_Default	Text	Possibly.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_10_Robar_NPC	Text	You people are crazy.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_11_Robar_NPC	Text	Here, gimme your map and I'll pinpoint the approximate location.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_12_Robar_NPC	Text	It's near an old ruin, an ancient tower.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_13_Any_Default	Text	Appreciate the help, Robar.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_14_Robar_NPC	Text	Though I may have just helped you into an early grave.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_15_Any_Default	Text	This time we'll take them by surprise.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_16_Robar_NPC	Text	Right. Good luck with that.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_17_Any_Default	Text	Farewell, Robar!
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_1_Starter_Formal	Text	What is this?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_2_Starter_Normal	Text	What's going on here?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_3_Starter_Slang	Text	What the hell did we just stumble into?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_4_Partner_Default	Text	These aren't Soraks. They seem human.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_5_Starter_Default	Text	What exactly are they doing?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_6_Partner_Default	Text	What's it look like they're doing? They're digging something up.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_7_History_Slang	Text	Just another dusty pile of rubble from before the Cataclysm.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_8_History_Normal	Text	This ruin dates back to Imperial times.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_8_History_Default	Text	A tower of magic perhaps, owned by one of the masters of Manacalon's Arcaneum.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_9_Starter_Default	Text	Who are these people? Scavengers?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_10_Partner_Default	Text	Hard to say. I see no tent or flag signifying their allegiance.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_11_Authority_Default	Text	Well, there is one way to find out.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_12_Selfpres_Default	Text	Perhaps we should sneak a little closer.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_13_Friendliness_Default	Text	Or simply walk in and see how friendly they are.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicWorkers01	Text	Alert!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicWorkers02_Normal	Text	All right - no talking, then… 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicWorkers03_Formal	Text	Looks like there won't be any parley… 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_1_Starter_Default	Text	So what do you think?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_2_Partner_Normal	Text	Humans.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_3_Partner_Slang	Text	They look like people to me.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_4_Partner_Formal	Text	I see nothing to indicate they are reptilian.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_5_Partner_Normal	Text	Unless, they have been transmogrified and are in disguise.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_6_Starter_Default	Text	What's that symbol there?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_7_Partner_Default	Text	The tattoo?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_8_Partner_Default	Text	Looks like an A.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_9_Commentator_Default	Text	They all have it.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_10_Cynical_Normal	Text	Guess they're all part of the same club.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_11_Cynical_Formal	Text	Perhaps it's a crude marker that indicates their allegiance. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_12_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Well, there's no reason to assume it signifies something sinister.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_13_Starter_Default	Text	Do you think it has anything to do with the Soraks?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_14_History_Default	Text	"A" could stand for Arivad.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_15_History_Default	Text	One of the many names of Sorr-Tarr, the Sorak God.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_16_Anyother_Default	Text	Are you kidding me?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_17_Anyother_Default	Text	That's not good.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_18_Starter_Default	Text	At least we know we're in the right place.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_19_Authority_Default	Text	Should we see what they're doing here?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_20_Selpres_Default	Text	Yes, but we should also keep an eye out for any stray Soraks.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_21_Violence_Default	Text	If a Sorak shows up, we need to cut off its head.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_1_Starter_Default	Text	Please don't kill me.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_2_Starter_Default	Text	What are you doing here?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_3_Starter_Default	Text	I'm just a worker.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_4_Starter_Default	Text	Are you tattooed with an A?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_5_Starter_Default	Text	I… you don't understand…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_6_Starter_Default	Text	Are you one of them?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_7_Starter_Default	Text	One of what? I'm just trying to survive. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_8_Starter_Default	Text	I had no choice.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_9_Written_Kill	Text	You must die.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_10_Written_LetLive	Text	Get out of here.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_11_Written_Tatoo	Text	Tell us about the tattoo.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_12_Written_Imps	Text	Are the Soraks around?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_13_Choice_Kill	Text	He is a Sorak slave! We should put him out of his misery!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_14_Choice_LetLive	Text	Run! Run for your life! 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_15_Choice_Tatoo	Text	What does the tattoo signify?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_16_Choice_Imps	Text	Are the Soraks close by?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_17_Starter_Default	Text	It's… I can't…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_18_Starter_Default	Text	He's dead. How is that possible? 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_19_Starter_Default	Text	How is any of this possible?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_20_Starter_Default	Text	He was doomed from the start.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_21_Starter_Default	Text	They're here. They're close…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_22_Starter_Default	Text	If they know that I…
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor1_Starter_NPC	Text	Another statue… 
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor2_Partner_Normal	Text	These guys really loved themselves.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor3_Partner_Formal	Text	These Manacalon wizards were quite fond of themselves.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor4_History_Normal	Text	Now, this is an Emperor.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor5_History_Normal	Text	A famous one, too? Lerithir Imradir… 
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor6_History_Normal	Text	…he was Emperor at the time of the Cataclysm.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor7_Partner_Normal	Text	Good job managing the trouble, mister.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor8_Partner_Formal	Text	He made history, but not the way he would have wanted.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_1_Arcana_Default	Text	This place is astounding.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_2_Partner_Default	Text	What kind of runes are those?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_3_Arcana_Default	Text	Enchanted runes. From the ancient Imperial period. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_4_Arcana_Default	Text	It is said they had eight schools of magic.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_5_Arcana_Default	Text	Each is represented here. All as equals.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_6_Pragmatic_Formal	Text	We weren't sent here to find runes. We were sent to find Soraks. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_7_Pragmatic_Slang	Text	Yeah, you can tell that to the Soraks right before they cut us to frickin' pieces.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_8_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	We're not here for runes, we're here for Soraks.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_1_Starter_Default	Text	That was… unexpected.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_2_Partner_Default	Text	This place is topsy-turvy.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_3_Partner_Default	Text	Magic from a time long forgotten. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_4_Joker_Default	Text	Remind me not to take a dump in that hole.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_5_Prag_Default	Text	Do you really have to make jokes?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_6_Joker_Default	Text	Yeah. It's in my contract. Did Carran not tell you?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_7_FormalJoker_Default	Text	Something funny suddenly comes to mind…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_8_Prag_Default	Text	Can you keep it to yourself?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_9_Starter_Default	Text	Might be good to remember what these blue currents can do.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicDoor_1_Starter_Default	Text	We did it!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicDoor_2_Partner_Default	Text	Was that insane puzzle the work of some long dead Manacalon wizard?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicDoor_3_Joke_Default	Text	Probably. Even from the tomb that magical arsehole is messing with us.  
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_1_Starter_Default	Text	They didn't die easily.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_2_Starter_Default	Text	Worthy foes, indeed.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_3_Partner_Formal	Text	Thankfully, we prevailed.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_4_Partner_Slang	Text	Got every one of those ugly bastards.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_5_Partner_Normal	Text	They bleed just like we do.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_6_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Now just need one of their frickin' heads.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_1_Commentator_Default	Text	Would you look at this?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_2_Starter_Default	Text	A crown of some kind?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_3_Partner_Default	Text	They seemed to keep their distance from it.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_4_Selpres_Default	Text	Maybe it's cursed.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_5_PlayerChoice_Default	Text	Look what I found.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_6_Educated_Default	Text	Let me take a look.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_7_Default_Default	Text	What language is this?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_8_Tirmarian_Default	Text	Looks like ancient Tirmarian.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_9_Tirmarian_Default	Text	If you find it, send for… this appears to be a name.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_10_Starter_Slang	Text	Is this the language of those damned lizards? 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_11_Starter_Normal	Text	That has to be a Sorak name.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_12_Partner_Default	Text	They were protecting it, so it must be valuable - to them, at least.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_13_Selpres_Default	Text	Take it then. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_14_Starter_Default	Text	Whew, I was worried it might be booby trapped.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_15_Partner_Default	Text	Perhaps we should rest before we head back.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_16_Selpres_Default	Text	I say we go.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_17_Selpres_Default	Text	Before the owner of that unpronounceable name shows his ugly face.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_18_Pragmatic_Default	Text	The mission is done after all.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_19_Selpres_Default	Text	Is it? Did someone cut off a Sorak's head?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_20_Selpres_Default	Text	All right, then - I'll do it!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_21_Pragmatic_Default	Text	The sooner we go, the sooner we can get back to Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_22_Starter_Default	Text	After you, friends.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrownWRITTENLINE	Text	Take the Crown
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_1_Starter_Default	Text	Interesting.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_2_Spellcaster_Default	Text	It's in remarkable condition considering how long it's been here.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_3_Starter_Default	Text	Do you think it has magical properties?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_4_Spellcaster_Slang	Text	By Arun's bones! I think it's a spellbook.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_5_Spellcaster_Default	Text	A spellbook that predates the Cataclysm.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_6_Starter_Default	Text	And I should care because?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_7_Spellcaster_Formal	Text	Who knows what it might contain.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_8_Spellcaster_Default	Text	A long-forgotten spell. A valuable secret.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_9_Spellcaster_Default	Text	But it looks like it's locked.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_10_Starter_Default	Text	Take it. Perhaps someone in Caer Cyflen will know how to open it.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_11_Spellcaster_Default	Text	First things first. We have a mission to complete.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_12_Spellcaster_Formal	Text	Indeed, but we have more pressing matters to attend to first.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_13_Spellcaster_Slang	Text	Yeah, but right now we have more important shit to take care of.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_1_Starter_Default	Text	Fancy.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_2_Starter_Default	Text	Beautiful craftsmanship.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_3_Starter_Default	Text	She looks like an empress.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_4_History_Default	Text	She doesn't bear the proper regalia. Not for a Manacalon.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_5_History_Default	Text	More likely she was a wizard, a master of the Arcaneum.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_6_Starter_Default	Text	Could this have been her home?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_7_History_Default	Text	Possibly.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_8_Joker_Default	Text	If it was, she sure let it go to hell. What a packrat. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_9_Joker_Default	Text	Her bones are probably buried somewhere under all these frickin' books.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_10_Starter_Default	Text	You are an idiot.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_1_Starter_Default	Text	You see that?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_2_Partner_Default	Text	Is that a Sorak?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_3_History_Default	Text	Don't be ridiculous. This is pre-Cataclysm.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_4_History_Default	Text	Before anyone knew what a Sorak even was.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_5_History_Default	Text	It's a dragon.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_6_Starter_Default	Text	It's no bigger than a man.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_7_Starter_Slang	Text	No shit?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_8_Starter_Normal	Text	If you say so.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_9_Partner_Normal	Text	I don't think so.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicPillar_1_Starter_Default	Text	Is this one of those rocks that…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicPillar_2_Partner_Default	Text	Nope. This place is insane.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicPillar_3_Partner_Default	Text	In the Badlands…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicPillar_4_Starter_Default	Text	I know… expect the unexpected. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_1_Starter_Default	Text	Well, that didn't do a damn thing. 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_2_Cynical_Default	Text	Did you really think that would open the door?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_3_Violence_Default	Text	I need to break some frickin' heads!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_4_Pragmatism_Default	Text	We need to be smarter about this. Think it through.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_5_Greed_Default	Text	We better get out of this with some gold in our pockets.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_6_SelfPres_Default	Text	Your faces are not the last faces I want to see.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_1_Starter_Default	Text	Stay hidden. They're here.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_2_Partner_Default	Text	Soraks?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_3_Starter_Default	Text	What else could they be?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_4_Partner_Normal	Text	You ready to do this?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_5_Partner_Formal	Text	This is it, friends. Stay strong.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_6_Starter_Default	Text	Get in position…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_7_Starter_Default	Text	…hit 'em hard and take 'em by surprise.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_8_Partner_Default	Text	Ready.
Narration/&CrownOwned_1_Partner_Normal	Text	You look a little pale. Is something wrong?
Narration/&CrownOwned_2_Partner_Formal	Text	Are you feeling poorly? You seem a bit pasty-faced.
Narration/&CrownOwned_3_Bearer_Default	Text	I don't feel too good. 
Narration/&CrownOwned_4_Cynical_Selfpres_Default	Text	I knew that old Crown was cursed.
Narration/&CrownOwned_5_Cynical_Selfpres_Slang	Text	Shit, I knew that hunk of junk was cursed.
Narration/&CrownOwned_6_Cynical_Selfpres_Formal	Text	Just as I feared. The crown is Cursed.
Narration/&CrownOwned_7_Partner_Default	Text	You don't know that.
Narration/&CrownOwned_8_Cynical_Selpres_Default	Text	Just get rid of it.
Narration/&CrownOwned_9_Cynical_Selfpres_Formal	Text	Perhaps we should leave it.
Narration/&CrownOwned_10_Bearer_Default	Text	No, we need it.
Narration/&CrownOwned_11_Partner_Default	Text	Need it? For what?
Narration/&CrownOwned_12_Bearer_Default	Text	For its power. I can feel it. Deep inside.
Narration/&CrownOwned_13_Friendly_Default	Text	Are you okay?
Narration/&CrownOwned_14_Bearer_Default	Text	I just need to rest for a bit.
Narration/&CrownOwned_15_Any1_Default	Text	Yeah, I'm not feeling too good either.
Narration/&CrownOwned_16_Any2_Default	Text	I'm exhausted as well.
Narration/&CrownOwned_17_Cynical_Selpres_Default	Text	Maybe the curse has affected us all.
Narration/&CrownOwned_18_Partner_Default	Text	Stop it. Don't be ridiculous.
Narration/&CrownOwned_19_Friendly_Default	Text	Fine, let's rest for a while. Set up camp.
Narration/&CrownOwned_20_Friendly_Formal	Text	I propose we set up camp and get some rest.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_1_Pragmatic_Default	Text	We did it! We brought back proof!
Narration/&BackWithCrown_2_Pragmatic_Formal	Text	Against all odds, we have recovered proof that Soraks do exist.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_3_Friendly_Default	Text	How do you feel?
Narration/&BackWithCrown_4_Bearer_Default	Text	Better.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_5_Friendly_Default	Text	Maybe that sickness was nothing.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_6_Friendly_Formal	Text	It might have been a simple fever, after all.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_7_Pragmatic_Default	Text	What about the Crown?
Narration/&BackWithCrown_8_Pragmatic_Default	Text	You know the Council will probably take it.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_9_Bearer_Default	Text	No!
Narration/&BackWithCrown_10_Pragmatic_Default	Text	We can't hide the fact that we found it with the Soraks.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_11_Pragmatic_Slang	Text	We can't bullshit them, it's got to be a Sorak thing.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_12_Bearer_Default	Text	It's our loot! Ours!
Narration/&BackWithCrown_13_Pragmatic_Default	Text	We have to declare anything of historical value… 
Narration/&BackWithCrown_14_Pragmatic_Default	Text	…and they have the right to buy it.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_15_Bearer_Default	Text	And if it's priceless?
Narration/&BackWithCrown_16_Cynical_Default	Text	Come on! They can do whatever they want.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_17_Bearer_Default	Text	Sure.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_18_Pragmatic_Default	Text	I guess we'll see.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_19_Pragmatic_Formal	Text	We must wait and see, and hope for the best.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_20_Cynical_Default	Text	Who fought the Soraks - us or them?
Narration/&BackWithCrown_21_Cynical_Normal	Text	They'd better remember that we fought the Soraks for this.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_22_Cynical_Formal	Text	We might want to remind them that they were wrong about the Soraks.
Narration/&Council02_1_1_Partner_Default	Text	Lord Carran!
Narration/&Council02_1_2_Carran_NPC	Text	Ah - deputies! 
Narration/&Council02_1_2_2_Carran_NPC	Text	I see you found some nice shiny loot.
Narration/&Council02_1_3_Carran_NPC	Text	So have you brought us the head of a Sorak?
Narration/&Council02_1_4_Partner_Default	Text	One head, slightly damaged.
Narration/&Council02_1_5_Carran_NPC	Text	Maraike preserve us! I'm sorry I asked!
Narration/&Council02_1_6_Partner_Default	Text	At least it's dead. You should have seen it alive.
Narration/&Council02_1_7_Carran_NPC	Text	I can only imagine.
Narration/&Council02_1_8_Partner_Default	Text	When's the next Council meeting?
Narration/&Council02_1_9_Carran_NPC	Text	When? Now, of course!
Narration/&Council02_1_10_Carran_NPC	Text	The rumor of your return has already reached the Palace.
Narration/&Council02_1_11_Carran_NPC	Text	They're waiting for you.
Narration/&Council02_1_12_Partner_Default	Text	They are?
Narration/&Council02_1_13_Carran_NPC	Text	Well, more for… this. But come on!
Narration/&Council02_1_14_Merton_NPC	Text	Now, there's a trophy.
Narration/&Council02_1_15_Merton_NPC	Text	And by the way, who's crazy now?
Narration/&Council02_1_16_Default_Default	Text	All right, you were right and we were wrong. They do exist. Happy now?
Narration/&Council02_1_17_Merton_NPC	Text	Kid, I've seen more than anyone in this town, yet nobody seems to believe me.
Narration/&Council02_1_18_Cynical_Default	Text	Maybe it's a curse.
Narration/&Council02_1_19_Merton_NPC	Text	The curse of being surrounded by idiots… 
Narration/&Council02_1_20_Carran_NPC	Text	If you don't mind, Merton, we have business to attend to.
Narration/&Council02_1_21_Merton_NPC	Text	Right. Say hello to the old lady for me, Carran!
Narration/&Council02_1_22_Default_Default	Text	Who's this guy again?
Narration/&Council02_1_23_Merton_NPC	Text	Arwin Merton. He used to be a legend - the first Scavenger, they say.
Narration/&Council02_1_24_Merton_NPC	Text	But now - well, you can see for yourself.
Narration/&Council02_1_25_Curious_Default	Text	Who's this old lady?
Narration/&Council02_1_26_Merton_NPC	Text	Just ignore him.
Narration/&Council02_1_27_Merton_NPC	Text	Let's go.
Narration/&Council02_2_1_EinarBoss_NPC	Text	Your thoughts, Dean Faisech?
Narration/&Council02_2_2_Towerboss_NPC	Text	I… well… it looks very much as the scriptures describe.
Narration/&Council02_2_3_Danantar_NPC	Text	Well, then - it seems we have a problem.
Narration/&Council02_2_4_EinarBoss_NPC	Text	It's a disaster! We all know what the Sorr-Akkath did on Tirmar!
Narration/&Council02_2_5_Partner_Default	Text	There's something else.
Narration/&Council02_2_6_Danantar_NPC	Text	What?
Narration/&Council02_2_7_Antiquarian_NPC	Text	A Crown?
Narration/&Council02_2_8_Towerboss_NPC	Text	Interesting. A very nice find.
Narration/&Council02_2_9_Partner_Default	Text	We don't want to sell it.
Narration/&Council02_2_10_Antiquarian_NPC	Text	Why not? You know we pay well.
Narration/&Council02_2_11_Partner_Default	Text	We want to keep it.
Narration/&Council02_2_12_Arcaneum_NPC	Text	I'd like to take a look at it, though.
Narration/&Council02_2_13_Partner_Default	Text	… 
Narration/&Council02_2_14_Authority_Default	Text	Come on, let them take a look.
Narration/&Council02_2_15_Arcaneum_NPC	Text	Thank you.
Narration/&Council02_2_16_Danantar_NPC	Text	Any ideas?
Narration/&Council02_2_17_Arcaneum_NPC	Text	It's quite massive… clearly Imperial in style… 
Narration/&Council02_2_18_Towerboss_NPC	Text	These runes remind me of the Imperial schools of magic… 
Narration/&Council02_2_19_Antiquarian_NPC	Text	I have a spell I'd like to cast on this.
Narration/&Council02_2_20_Princess_NPC	Text	My lords! This deputy is clearly unwell!
Narration/&Council02_2_21_Danantar_NPC	Text	What?
Narration/&Council02_3_1_Bearer_Default	Text	What happened?
Narration/&Council02_3_2_Friendly_Default	Text	You passed out.
Narration/&Council02_3_3_Bearer_Default	Text	Where are we?
Narration/&Council02_3_4_Friendly_Default	Text	The Temple of Einar.
Narration/&Council02_3_5_Friendly_Default	Text	Marshal Beric Sunblaze himself invited us to stay here.
Narration/&Council02_3_6_Pragmatic_Default	Text	We certainly made an impression on the Council.
Narration/&Council02_3_7_Pragmatic_Default	Text	They believe you're attuned to the Crown… 
Narration/&Council02_3_8_Pragmatic_Default	Text	…that you can't be separated from it.
Narration/&Council02_3_9_Bearer_Default	Text	What? So it is cursed?
Narration/&Council02_3_10_Cynical_Default	Text	They're not sure. All these big brains, and they're stumped.
Narration/&Council02_3_11_Cynical_Default	Text	They cast spells on the crown, on you… 
Narration/&Council02_3_12_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Between that and the Soraks, we caused quite a fuss out there.
Narration/&Council02_3_13_Pragmatic_Default	Text	They'll reconvene the Council when you're ready.
Narration/&Council02_3_14_Pragmatic_Default	Text	But trust me, there's a lot of people who want to talk to you first.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_1_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	Text	It's an honor, deputies.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_2_Authority_Default	Text	Who are you?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_3_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	Text	My name is Maddy Greenisle. I work for the Tower of Knowledge.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_4_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	Text	I'm just a junior aide in the Council…
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_5_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	Text	…but if you ever need to contact my superiors without going through official channels…
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_6_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	Text	…just see me at the Tower, downtown.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_7_Nosy_Selfpres_Default	Text	Why the sudden interest in us?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_8_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	Text	You proved yourselves in the Badlands…
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_9_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	Text	…and we in the Tower of Knowledge value skilled adventurers.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_10_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	Text	If you find anything of historical value, we'll pay well…
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_11_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	Text	And if things go well, we might share some of our own secrets.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_12_Authority_Default	Text	All right - we'll think about it.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_1_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	Greetings, Sorak slayers!
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_2_Friendly_Default	Text	Hello.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_3_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	I am Halman Summer of the Guild of Antiquarians.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_4_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	I am instructed to invite you to visit us at the Embassy of the Snow Alliance.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_5_Lawfulness_Default	Text	You're based at an embassy? I thought the Council was neutral.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_6_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	We don't have a house of our own in Caer Cyflen - unlike the Tower of Knowledge…
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_7_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	…how about that for neutrality?
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_8_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	Anyway, we'd be interested in any antiquities you might bring back. 
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_9_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	We pay very well, even for things you might think are worthless.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_10_Cynical_Default	Text	Like the Scavengers?
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_11_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	The Scavengers? They'd sell an antique Emperor's sword for its metal value.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_12_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	But we can offer more than gold.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_13_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	Antique magical items, for instance. You'll never find their like elsewhere.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_14_Friendly_Default	Text	Good to know. Thanks for the invitation.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Can I ask for a minute of your time, deputies?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_2_Player_Authority	Text	We're in kind of a hurry.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_3_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	I know. I won't delay you long.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_4_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	My name is Heddlon Surespell. I represent the Arcaneum.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_5_AnyNotElf_Default	Text	And the Arcaneum belongs to the New Empire. Do you really want to be seen talking to us?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_6_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	My business is magic, not politics. And no, I have no quarrel with you.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_7_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	You may not see us Imperials as friends, but we take the Council very seriously.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_8_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	We are particularly interested in anything from the Old Empire that you might find in the Badlands.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_9_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Anything from the Manacalon-era Arcaneum, even more so.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_10_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Of course we'd pay you handsomely for this Crown, but I know that is not possible.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_11_Joker_Default	Text	You're smarter than you look.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_12_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Also quite indifferent to mockery.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_13_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Anyway, we have an unrivaled trove of magical and other knowledge.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_14_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Think it over. You can find me at the Gravekeep's Cask.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_15_Lawful_Default	Text	Really? Not at the embassy?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_16_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	What can I say? I love Martel's beer. Even though it tastes like donkey piss…
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_17_Selfpres_Default	Text	What? How did he… ?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_18_Selfpres_Default	Text	That was our joke, the first day we met. Was he spying on us?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_19_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Maybe he just agrees about the taste.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_1_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Text	Would you have a moment, deputies?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_2_Authority_Default	Text	All right, but make it quick.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_3_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Text	I'll do my best.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_4_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Text	I am Joriel Foxeye, from the Circle of Danantar.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_5_Nosy_Default	Text	The same magic school where the Princess studies?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_6_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Text	Exactly. 
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_7_Nosy_Default	Text	Is she a good student? A powerful wizard?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_8_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Text	That's not for me to say - and you seemed to be in a rush?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_9_Nosy_Default	Text	Fine.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_10_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Text	I just want you to know that our grand master Edvan Danantar has noticed you.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_11_Joker_Default	Text	He talked a lot, for sure.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_12_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Text	He's a man of great authority.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_13_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Text	He'd like you to know that our doors are open to you if you'd care to visit us.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_13_2_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Text	You can find me at Sunblaze Court.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_14_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Interested in Badlands treasures, I suppose, like everyone else?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_15_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Text	Well, if you ever come across old spellbooks or spell scrolls, we'd love to see them.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_16_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Text	In return, we have the largest collection of spells and potion recipes you could ever hope to see.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_17_Nosy_Default	Text	More than the Arcaneum?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_18_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Text	They would disagree - but yes.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_19_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Text	Now, if you were to prefer feeding the New Empire's wizards with more magical knowledge than the Principality…
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_20_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Text	…that would be troubling to many on the Council.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_21_Lawful_Default	Text	Neutrality means we don't treat you any differently than we treat them.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_22_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Text	Of course. Neutrality is the rule.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_23_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Text	Good day to you, deputies.
Narration/&Council02_4_1_TowerBoss_NPC	Text	Ah - our crownbearer is up again!
Narration/&Council02_4_2_Speaker_NPC	Text	Honorable Council Members! Please take your seats!
Narration/&Council02_4_3_Speaker_NPC	Text	Lord Danantar has the floor.
Narration/&Council02_4_4_Danantar_NPC	Text	Thank you.
Narration/&Council02_4_5_Danantar_NPC	Text	I have confirmed that our deputy is indeed magically attuned to the Crown.
Narration/&Council02_4_6_Danantar_NPC	Text	It is… an uncommonly powerful attunement, unlike anything I've seen.
Narration/&Council02_4_7_Danantar_NPC	Text	I strongly recommend against forcing a separation.
Narration/&Council02_4_8_Speaker_NPC	Text	Chancellor Gormsdottir?
Narration/&Council02_4_9_AntiquarianBoss_NPC	Text	With the Council's permission, I'd like to try a little experiment.
Narration/&Council02_4_10_AntiquarianBoss_NPC	Text	I have here the gem that Captain Merran recovered recently.
Narration/&Council02_4_11_AntiquarianBoss_NPC	Text	I have reason to believe that it might be… 
Narration/&Council02_4_12_AntiquarianBoss_NPC	Text	As I suspected! It belongs to the Crown!
Narration/&Council02_4_13_Arcaneum_NPC	Text	What have you done?
Narration/&Council02_4_14_EinarBoss_NPC	Text	Commander! Take Her Royal Highness to safety!
Narration/&Council02_4_15_Princess_NPC	Text	Wait!
Narration/&Council02_5_1_Arcaneum_NPC	Text	Are you going to faint again?
Narration/&Council02_5_2_Crownbearer_WRITTEN	Text	I just had a… vision, I guess it was.
Narration/&Council02_5_3_Crownbearer_WRITTEN	Text	It's nothing.
Narration/&Council02_5_4_Crownbearer_WRITTEN	Text	I must… find the other gems.
Narration/&Council02_5_5_Crownbearer_Answer	Text	I just had a vision.
Narration/&Council02_5_6_Crownbearer_Answer	Text	It's nothing.
Narration/&Council02_5_7_Crownbearer_Answer	Text	The Crown wants the other gems back.
Narration/&Council02_5_5_Danantar_NPC	Text	A vision? In an instant?
Narration/&Council02_5_6_Crownbearer_Default	Text	I was fighting Soraks - but I wasn't myself.
Narration/&Council02_5_7_Crownbearer_Default	Text	Then… who were you?
Narration/&Council02_5_8_Crownbearer_Default	Text	A paladin… powerful… 
Narration/&Council02_5_9_Crownbearer_Default	Text	…from Tirmar.
Narration/&Council02_5_10_Danantar_NPC	Text	That is… unsettling.
Narration/&Council02_5_11_AntiquarianBoss_NPC	Text	Honorable delegates, I suggest we focus on the Soraks for now.
Narration/&Council02_5_12_Danantar_NPC	Text	I concur.
Narration/&Council02_5_13_EinarBoss_NPC	Text	What about this artifact? The other gems?
Narration/&Council02_5_14_TowerBoss_NPC	Text	What?
Narration/&Council02_5_15_Crownbearer_Default	Text	I think I can find them. I can… feel them.
Narration/&Council02_5_16_EinarBoss_NPC	Text	You said it wasn't sentient.
Narration/&Council02_5_17_Danantar_NPC	Text	This is old Manacalon magic. Anything is possible.
Narration/&Council02_5_18_Danantar_NPC	Text	Let the crownbearer and the other deputies follow that quest.
Narration/&Council02_5_19_Danantar_NPC	Text	Find the other gems if you can, but keep us informed.
Narration/&Council02_5_20_Danantar_NPC	Text	In the meantime, we will formulate a response to the Soraks.
Narration/&Council02_5_21_AntiquarianBoss_NPC	Text	Let's vote. Delegates - do you agree?
Narration/&Council02_5_22_All_NPC	Text	Aye!
Narration/&Council02_5_23_Speaker_NPC	Text	Your Royal Highness?
Narration/&Council02_5_24_Princess_NPC	Text	Oh? pardon me. Yes, I concur… 
Narration/&Council02_5_25_Speaker_NPC	Text	To which proposition, Your Highness?
Narration/&Council02_5_26_Princess_NPC	Text	I mean, aye. They should go and find the diamonds - the gems.
Narration/&Council02_5_27_Speaker_NPC	Text	So resolved! Let it be recorded!
Narration/&Council02_5_28_Speaker_NPC	Text	Thank you, honored delegates. The Council is now in recess.
Narration/&Council02_5_29_Char1_Default	Text	What was that?
Narration/&Council02_5_30_Char1_Default	Text	You had a vision?
Narration/&Council02_5_31_Char2_Default	Text	What do you mean the Crown wants its missing gems?
Narration/&Council02_5_32_Crownbearer_Default	Text	I… I can't explain. I just feel it. Anyway, we have a new mission.
Narration/&Council02_5_33_Char3_Default	Text	All right, then. So where are we going, crownbearer?
Narration/&Council02_5_34_Crownbearer_Default	Text	I think… the Crown knows.
Narration/&Merton_01_1_Merton_NPC	Text	Look who's here! The Sorak hunters themselves!
Narration/&Merton_01_2_Any_Default	Text	It's Merton, right? Arwin Merton?
Narration/&Merton_01_3_Merton_NPC	Text	Damn right!
Narration/&Merton_01_4_Any_Default	Text	First Scavenger? Where does that come from?
Narration/&Merton_01_5_Merton_NPC	Text	Long story, kid.
Narration/&Merton_01_6_Merton_NPC	Text	Short version: When we started crossing the Marches to the Badlands, I was one of the first.
Narration/&Merton_01_7_Merton_NPC	Text	Now, I'm just the ugliest one still standing.
Narration/&Merton_01_8_Any_Default	Text	What should we know about the Badlands? Any advice?
Narration/&Merton_01_9_Merton_NPC	Text	Bring a good cleric with good healing spells. You'll need them.
Narration/&Merton_01_10_Any_Default	Text	You're a legend. Why do you seem so sour?
Narration/&Merton_01_11_Merton_NPC	Text	Sour? It's this ale that's sour, that's all.
Narration/&Merton_01_12_Merton_NPC	Text	The high and mighty Council, paying clueless kids like you to go and get killed in the Badlands.
Narration/&Merton_01_13_Merton_NPC	Text	But they're not asking good old Arwin - nooo. Go figure.
Narration/&Merton_01_14_Merton_NPC	Text	It's because I got them figured out.
Narration/&Merton_01_15_Any_Default	Text	Figured out how?
Narration/&Merton_01_16_Merton_NPC	Text	This Legacy Council is full of it.
Narration/&Merton_01_17_Merton_NPC	Text	Acting all united and lovey-dovey while they plot to rob each other.
Narration/&Merton_01_18_Merton_NPC	Text	Wouldn't surprise me if some of them were even Soraks in disguise. You know they can shapeshift.
Narration/&Merton_01_19_Any_Default	Text	Uh - okay…
Narration/&Merton_01_20_Merton_NPC	Text	Hey, I was right about them hiding in the Badlands, wasn't I?
Narration/&Council03_1_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Honorable members of the Council, please be seated!
Narration/&Council03_2_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	The Legacy Council is now in session!
Narration/&Council03_3_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Lord Keenmind has the floor.
Narration/&Council03_4_Keenmind_NPC	Text	Honorable members of the Council, we at the Arcaneum… 
Narration/&Council03_5_Keenmind_NPC	Text	…have gathered crucial information about this Crown.
Narration/&Council03_6_Keenmind_NPC	Text	This is indeed the Crown of the Magister, belonging to Kaseinax, Eternal Soul of the Eight Traditions… 
Narration/&Council03_7_Keenmind_NPC	Text	…ninth and last Magister of the Manacalon Arcaneum.
Narration/&Council03_8_Keenmind_NPC	Text	At the time, there were eight masters of magic, one for each of the old schools.
Narration/&Council03_9_Keenmind_NPC	Text	In time of need, each the masters lent their gem to the Magister, the head of the Arcaneum.
Narration/&Council03_10_Keenmind_NPC	Text	Placed in the Crown, they granted additional powers… 
Narration/&Council03_11_Keenmind_NPC	Text	…that enabled the Magister to cast spells or perform rituals of incredible power.
Narration/&Council03_12_Keenmind_NPC	Text	Such as the closing of the Rift from Tirmar.
Narration/&Council03_13_All_NPC	Text	overlapping murmurs
Narration/&Council03_14_Keenmind_NPC	Text	Indeed.
Narration/&Council03_15_Keenmind_NPC	Text	Now… there is some debate about… 
Narration/&Council03_16_Keenmind_NPC	Text	…whether the Crown, with all its gems… 
Narration/&Council03_17_Keenmind_NPC	Text	…could possibly open another Rift…
Narration/&Council03_18_All_NPC	Text	overlapping protestations
Narration/&Council03_19_Keenmind_NPC	Text	…or even reopen the previous one.
Narration/&Council03_20_Towerboss_NPC	Text	Nonsense! The Rift has been closed for a millennium!
Narration/&Council03_21_Danantar_NPC	Text	Solasta paid a high enough price for that!
Narration/&Council03_22_Antiquariansboss_NPC	Text	Have you been to the Badlands recently?
Narration/&Council03_23_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Order!
Narration/&Council03_24_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Marshal Sunblaze has the floor.
Narration/&Council03_25_Einarboss_NPC	Text	For our part, now that the existence of Sorr-Akkath on Solasta has been confirmed…
Narration/&Council03_26_Einarboss_NPC	Text	…we have gathered proof that they are operating everywhere in the Eastern Kingdoms.
Narration/&Council03_27_Einarboss_NPC	Text	Including here, in the Principality of Masgarth.
Narration/&Council03_28_Towerboss_NPC	Text	Impossible!
Narration/&Council03_29_Einarboss_NPC	Text	The Soraks are looking for the Crown and its gems. That cannot be a coincidence.
Narration/&Council03_30_Antiquariansboss_NPC	Text	A powerful artifact, certainly - but reopening the Rift? 
Narration/&Council03_31_Antiquariansboss_NPC	Text	It took all the gods of Tirmar to open it!
Narration/&Council03_32_Einarboss_NPC	Text	No one knows for sure what the Crown can do.
Narration/&Council03_33_Keenmind_NPC	Text	It's a theory.
Narration/&Council03_34_Keenmind_NPC	Text	As you know, it protects itself from our divination spells… 
Narration/&Council03_35_Keenmind_NPC	Text	…that is one of its mysterious powers.
Narration/&Council03_36_Towerboss_NPC	Text	Then why would the Soraks think they know better?
Narration/&Council03_37_Einarboss_NPC	Text	Because they're Soraks!
Narration/&Council03_38_Einarboss_NPC	Text	Their people, their culture - they must have been obsessing about this for a thousand years!
Narration/&Council03_39_Einarboss_NPC	Text	While we spent that time fighting each other, they had to stick together and hide to survive.
Narration/&Council03_40_Towerboss_NPC	Text	Fables and conjectures!
Narration/&Council03_41_Antiquariansboss_NPC	Text	Perhaps.
Narration/&Council03_42_Einarboss_NPC	Text	But can we take the risk?
Narration/&Council03_43_Danantar_NPC	Text	The Crown must be secured!
Narration/&Council03_44_Antiquariansboss_NPC	Text	The Crown belongs to those who found it. Those are the rules.
Narration/&Council03_45_Antiquariansboss_NPC	Text	The quest for the gems should be completed.
Narration/&Council03_46_Antiquariansboss_NPC	Text	Only this way can we learn more about the Crown and its powers.
Narration/&Council03_47_Towerboss_NPC	Text	These deputies - well, they're not strong enough! No offense.
Narration/&Council03_48_Antiquariansboss_NPC	Text	Tell that to the Crown. And they've done well enough so far, wouldn't you say?
Narration/&Council03_49_Towerboss_NPC	Text	This is nonsense!
Narration/&Council03_50_Princess_NPC	Text	Maybe the deputies would like to speak.
Narration/&Council03_51_Princess_NPC	Text	After all, they are members of the Council now, aren't they?
Narration/&Council03_52_Authority_Normal_WRITTEN	Text	We'll continue the quest.
Narration/&Council03_55_Greed_Default_WRITTEN	Text	Give us weapons.
Narration/&Council03_58_Lawfulness_Default_WRITTEN	Text	You should trust us more.
Narration/&Council03_61_Selfishness_Default_WRITTEN	Text	The Crown is ours.
Narration/&Council03_52_Authority_Normal	Text	We feel perfectly able to continue searching for the gems.
Narration/&Council03_53_Authority_Formal	Text	With all due respect, we are confident that we can fulfill this quest ourselves.
Narration/&Council03_54_Authority_Slang	Text	We got this. Really, it's under control.
Narration/&Council03_55_Greed_Default	Text	You can give us the means to be stronger. Weapons, armor, maybe some spells?
Narration/&Council03_56_Greed_Formal	Text	May we be so bold as to ask your for material support? Weapons, armor, or spells, for instance?
Narration/&Council03_57_Greed_Slang	Text	We'd be stronger if you tossed a few things our way. You know - weapons, armor, spells - that sort of thing.
Narration/&Council03_58_Lawfulness_Default	Text	You may trust that we are devoted to this quest. We are well aware of its importance.
Narration/&Council03_59_Lawfulness_Formal	Text	We are fully devoted to the quest, and perfectly aware of its vital importance.
Narration/&Council03_60_Lawfulness_Slang	Text	We get it - this is big. We won't let you down!
Narration/&Council03_61_Selfishness_Default	Text	We didn't change our mind about the Crown - it's ours!
Narration/&Council03_62_Selfishness_Formal	Text	We must reiterate that we have no intention of giving up the Crown.
Narration/&Council03_63_Selfishness_Slang	Text	Let's be clear. The Crown is ours, and it stays ours.
Narration/&Council03_64_Danantar_NPC	Text	Confidence? I like that.
Narration/&Council03_65_Towerboss_NPC	Text	Preposterous!
Narration/&Council03_66_Antiquariansboss_NPC	Text	Five more gems to find. Do you even have a lead?
Narration/&Council03_67_Authority_Default	Text	Yes - the best lead possible. The Crown itself tells us where to go.
Narration/&Council03_68_Einarboss_Default	Text	The Soraks will come after you - you know that?
Narration/&Council03_69_Einarboss_Default	Text	But you have our complete support in this struggle.
Narration/&Council03_70_Friendliness_Formal	Text	Our thanks, Marshal.
Narration/&Council03_71_Friendliness_Normal	Text	Thanks.
Narration/&Council03_72_Antiquariansboss_NPC	Text	Don't overestimate yourselves, deputies!
Narration/&Council03_73_Einarboss_NPC	Text	That's right! We can't risk the Soraks overpowering them and taking the Crown!
Narration/&Council03_74_Danantar_NPC	Text	Well, you're welcome to provide them with whatever weapons and armors you like, Marshal.
Narration/&Council03_75_Greed_Default	Text	We're just trying to increase our chance of success.
Narration/&Council03_76_Towerboss_NPC	Text	Of course you are.
Narration/&Council03_77_Keenmind_NPC	Text	We might have a few spells that can increase your chance of… survival.
Narration/&Council03_78_Danantar_NPC	Text	Trust is a hot topic, these days.
Narration/&Council03_73_Einarboss_trust_NPC	Text	Nobody here questions your dedication. You've done a lot already.
Narration/&Council03_71_Einarboss_NPC	Text	Yet, we should support you in your efforts.
Narration/&Council03_72_Keenmind_NPC	Text	And we will.
Narration/&Council03_73_Antiquariansboss_NPC	Text	You understand, though - it is your responsibility to keep the Crown out of the wrong hands?
Narration/&Council03_74_Selfishness_Default	Text	The Crown chose us. I doubt it would do any good to anyone else.
Narration/&Council03_75_Keenmind_NPC	Text	Oh, so you're experts in Manacalon sorcery now?
Narration/&Council03_76_Einarboss_NPC	Text	I can only concur. You have a responsibility, and it's more important than ownership.
Narration/&Council03_77_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	If that is all, may we conclude?
Narration/&Council03_78_Princess_NPC	Text	I'd like to say a word, if that is appropriate.
Narration/&Council03_79_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Of course, Your Highness. We are listening.
Narration/&Council03_80_Princess_NPC	Text	I think our brave deputies shouldn't be, you know, sleeping in a… city inn.
Narration/&Council03_81_Princess_NPC	Text	We have a very comfortable residence near the Palace. 
Narration/&Council03_82_Princess_NPC	Text	They would be safer there, don't you think?
Narration/&Council03_83_Princess_NPC	Text	That would be my - I mean, our - part in supporting the quest.
Narration/&Council03_84_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Ahem - Your Highness?
Narration/&Council03_85_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	I must remind you that your decisions as head of state are not subject to Council approval.
Narration/&Council03_86_Princess_NPC	Text	Oh! Right…
Narration/&Council03_87_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Might I suggest that you reiterate your offer outside these walls?
Narration/&Council03_88_Princess_NPC	Text	Of course. I beg the Council's pardon.
Narration/&Council03_89_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Not at all, Your Highness.
Narration/&Council03_90_Danantar_NPC	Text	Then I think that is all?
Narration/&Council03_91_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Thank you. The Legacy Council is now in recess.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_1_Captain_NPC	Text	A word, please, deputies?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_2_Any_Default	Text	Sure.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_2_Any_Formal	Text	Of course.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_2_Any_Slang	Text	What's up?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_3_Captain_NPC	Text	Her Royal Highness asked me to reiterate her offer to accommodate you at the Palace Residence.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_4_Any_Default	Text	What's that?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_4_Any_Formal	Text	I'm not sure what that is.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_5_Captain_NPC	Text	A house for plenipotentiaries, emissaries, and other guests of the Court.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_6_Any_Default	Text	Sounds nice.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_6_Any_Formal	Text	It's an honor!
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_7_Captain_NPC	Text	You don't say?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_8_Any_Default	Text	Where is this residence?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_9_Captain_NPC	Text	In the Palace. Ask for Ravensworth, the royal butler. He'll show you.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_10_Captain_NPC	Text	Oh, another thing…
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_11_Any_Default	Text	Yes?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_12_Captain_NPC	Text	I am to give this to any senior deputy of the Council.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_13_Any_Default	Text	What's this?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_14_Captain_NPC	Text	A command word, to teleport your party to the city's Imperial Gate.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_15__Any_Default	Text	Teleport?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_16_Any_Default	Text	We can't do that, I'm pretty sure.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_17_Captain_NPC	Text	Well, word is that in the Badlands…
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_18_Captain_NPC	Text	…you may come across functioning Major Gates.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_19_Captain_NPC	Text	If you do, use this command word and you'll be brought back here.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_20_Captain_NPC	Text	Take note of any command word on the Gate you find…
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_21_Captain_NPC	Text	…and you'll be able to return there the same way.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_22_Any_Default	Text	That's fantastic!
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_23_Captain_NPC	Text	Don't get too excited.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_24_Captain_NPC	Text	So far, no one's found any.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_25_Any_Default	Text	Oh. Right. Thanks anyway.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_26_Captain_NPC	Text	Stay in the light, senior deputies.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_27_Any_Default	Text	You too, Captain.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_1_DalonLark_NPC	Text	Clear skies, adventurers!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_2_EinarWorshipper_Default	Text	Fire to your blade!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_3_DalonLark_NPC	Text	One of the faithful, I see. Nice to meet you!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_4_DalonLark_NPC	Text	I am Chaplain Dalon Lark.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_5_DalonLark_NPC	Text	You may come here at any time to seek the help of the Church.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_6_AnyBeliever_Einar	Text	That is good to know, Chaplain!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_7_NonBeliever_Default	Text	Hello!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_8_AnyBeliever_Default	Text	What do you do here?
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_9_DalonLark_NPC	Text	I represent the Church of Einar, the god of valor and fidelity.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_10_DalonLark_NPC	Text	We provide various services for those who need them.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_11_Cynical_Default	Text	And can pay for them?
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_12_DalonLark_NPC	Text	Those who seek his healing are rarely poor.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_13_Any_Default	Text	We do require your services.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_14_Any_Default	Text	Thank you - we need to go.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_15_DalonLark_NPC	Text	Stay in the light, adventurers!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_WRITTEN_ExitLine	Text	We should go.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_WRITTEN_ShopLine	Text	We need your services.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Clear skies, adventurers!
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_2_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Anything new for the Arcaneum?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_3_Any_Slang	Text	Check this out!
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_4_Any_Default	Text	Possibly.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_5_Any_Slang	Text	Just passing by.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_6_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	That's nice of you.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_7_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Stay in the light!
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_Exitline	Text	Just passing by.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_Offer	Text	Let's talk business!
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_1_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Text	Deputies.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_2_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Text	Do you have anything for the Circle?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_3_Any_Default	Text	Take a look.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_4_Any_Formal	Text	We might.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_5_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Text	Not really. Just stopped by to say hello.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_6_Any_Default	Text	It's an honor. 
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_7_JorielFoxeye_NPC	Text	Stay in the light, deputies!
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_Exitline	Text	Just saying hello.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_Offer	Text	What about this?
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_1_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	Clear skies, my friends!
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_2_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	You have some treasure in your backpacks?
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_3_Any_Slang	Text	Feast your eyes on this!
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_4_Any_Default	Text	See what you think of this.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_5_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	Just passing by to say hello.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_6_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	Ah, well. It was good to see you.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_7_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	See you next time, friends!
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_ExitLine	Text	Just passing by.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_Offer	Text	What about this?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_1_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	Text	Deputies! How are you today?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_2_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	Text	Do you have some lovely loot from the Badlands?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_3_Any_Slang	Text	How 'bout that?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_4_Any_Default	Text	Indeed.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_5_Any_Slang	Text	Just missed your smiling face, Miss Greenisle!
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_6_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	Text	Such nice manners! All too rare, these days.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_7_MaddyGreenisle_NPC	Text	Clear skies to you!
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_Exitline	Text	Just missed you.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_Offer	Text	How about that?
Narration/&Council4_1_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Honorable delegates, please be seated!
Narration/&Council4_2_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	The Legacy Council is now in session!
Narration/&Council4_3_Danantar_NPC	Text	Ah - senior deputies! What news is there?
Narration/&Council4_4_Authority_Normal	Text	We're stuck, my lord.
Narration/&Council4_5_Authority_Formal	Text	My lord, I'm afraid the situation is less than ideal.
Narration/&Council4_6_Authority_Slang	Text	It's not good news, my Lord.
Narration/&Council4_7_Faisech_NPC	Text	Meaning what, exactly?
Narration/&Council4_8_Any_Default	Text	We have six gems, but we can't seem to find the others.
Narration/&Council4_9_Gormsdottir_NPC	Text	Two gems missing?
Narration/&Council4_10_Faisech_NPC	Text	Perhaps they've been destroyed.
Narration/&Council4_11_Keenmind_NPC	Text	We tested the first one - it can't be done!
Narration/&Council4_12_Danantar_NPC	Text	They must be magically concealed.
Narration/&Council4_13_Sunblaze_NPC	Text	So the Crown must remain incomplete?
Narration/&Council4_14_Gormsdottir_NPC	Text	Maybe the Soraks have the missing gems.
Narration/&Council4_15_Gormsdottir_NPC	Text	After all, they attacked you more than once. They're clearly still after the Crown.
Narration/&Council4_16_Faisech_NPC	Text	If you can't find the gems, why keep the Crown out there?
Narration/&Council4_17_Faisech_NPC	Text	It will keep attracting the Soraks.
Narration/&Council4_18_Danantar_NPC	Text	The attunement, remember?
Narration/&Council4_19_Faisech_NPC	Text	I'm sorry, senior deputies, but despite the attunement...
Narration/&Council4_20_Faisech_NPC	Text	...I believe the Crown should be secured...
Narration/&Council4_21_Faisech_NPC	Text	...and secured by more than four adventurers who spend their nights camped in the Badlands!
Narration/&Council4_22_Sunblaze_NPC	Text	We can't do that to them! They have served the Council faithfully!
Narration/&Council4_23_Faisech_NPC	Text	Don't be naive! We are facing a major threat!
Narration/&Council4_24_Faisech_NPC	Text	You understand the meaning of sacrifice, and so should they!
Narration/&Council4_25_Authority_Normal	Text	We have searched the Badlands for these gems, at our own risk.
Narration/&Council4_26_Crownbearer_Normal	Text	We trusted you to keep your word and leave us the Crown.
Narration/&Council4_27_Danantar_NPC	Text	If I may, I think we need more time to consider the situation.
Narration/&Council4_28_Faisech_NPC	Text	More time? How much time?
Narration/&Council4_29_Danantar_NPC	Text	Maybe just...give it a night.
Narration/&Council4_30_Gormsdottir_NPC	Text	I could use the day to consult with my people.
Narration/&Council4_31_Keenmind_NPC	Text	So could I.
Narration/&Council4_32_Danantar_NPC	Text	Fine, then! Anyone against?
Narration/&Council4_33_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Thank you, Lord Danantar.
Narration/&Council4_34_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	The Legacy Council is now ajdourned!
Narration/&Council4_35_Selfpres_Normal	Text	I have a bad feeling about this.
Narration/&Council4_36_Crownbearer_Normal	Text	I knew it! They'll take the Crown, and never mind what that does to me!
Narration/&Council4_37_Crownbearer_Slang	Text	Typical! Sat there on their pretty chairs...doesn't matter if I die!
Narration/&Council4_38_Authority_Normal	Text	This is wrong.
Narration/&Council4_39_Selfpres_Normal	Text	We could run.
Narration/&Council4_40_Authority_Normal	Text	What's the point? We know what's at stake.
Narration/&Council4_41_Crownbearer_Normal	Text	They're right about one thing.
Narration/&Council4_42_Crownbearer_Normal	Text	The Soraks will keep coming after us. After the Crown.
Narration/&Council4_43_Authority_Normal	Text	We could retrace our steps - go back to where we found the gems. Perhaps there's a trail we overlooked.
Narration/&Council4_44_Crownbearer_Normal	Text	There's nothing anymore - I can't feel another gem anywhere!
Narration/&Council4_45_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Excuse me, senior deputies.
Narration/&Council4_46_Highclass_Formal	Text	Master Surespell.
Narration/&Council4_47_Any_Normal	Text	Clear skies, Heddlon.
Narration/&Council4_48_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	I would advise you to avoid the Palace Residence tonight.
Narration/&Council4_49_Crownbearer_Normal	Text	What? Why?
Narration/&Council4_50_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	I'm not at liberty to say...just trust me.
Narration/&Council4_51_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	You have your lodgings at the Gravekeep's Cask. You should spend the night there.
Narration/&Council4_52_Selfpres_Normal	Text	What kind of advice is that?
Narration/&Council4_53_Selfpres_Formal	Text	You must realize your suggestion is...unusual. Suspicious, even.
Narration/&Council4_54_Selfpres_Slang	Text	Are you crazy? Or are you up to something?
Narration/&Council4_55_Nosy_Normal	Text	Are you really working for the Arcaneum? 
Narration/&Council4_56_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Why else would I be here?
Narration/&Council4_57_Mean_Normal	Text	This elf is...
Narration/&Council4_58_Lawful_Normal	Text	What do you think?
Narration/&Council4_59_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	It sounds like a warning.
Narration/&Council4_60_Selfpres_Normal	Text	Or a threat!
Narration/&Council4_61_Lawful_Normal	Text	Can we trust him?
Narration/&Council4_62_Carver_Normal	Text	Trust the New Empire?
Narration/&Council4_63_Greed_Normal	Text	I have no idea what to do, but I'd like to sleep in a bed tonight.
Narration/&Council4_64_Cynical_Normal	Text	I miss Karel's beer.
Narration/&Council4_65_Any4_Normal	Text	And Merton's sweet talk.
Narration/&Council4_66_Cynical_Normal	Text	I'd prefer the residence.
Narration/&Council4_67_Cynical_Normal	Text	I like Captain Ironshell kissing me goodnight.
Narration/&Council4_68_Authority_Normal	Text	Maybe in your dreams.
Narration/&NightAttack_1_Selfpres_Default	Text	Soraks - here?
Narration/&NightAttack_2_Selfpres_Slang	Text	Soraks! Right here in our damn room!
Narration/&NightAttack_3_Selfpres_Formal	Text	The Sorr-Akkath in the palace residence!
Narration/&NightAttack_4_Pragmatic_Default	Text	We were warned.
Narration/&NightAttack_5_Nosy_Default	Text	Surespell? How did he know?
Narration/&NightAttack_6_Nosy_Default	Text	Why would he know what the Soraks would do?
Narration/&NightAttack_7_Pragmatic_Default	Text	He tried to warn us. Not what an enemy would do.
Narration/&NightAttack_8_Pragmatic_Slang	Text	He tried to save our hides, remember?
Narration/&NightAttack_9_Pragmatic_Formal	Text	His warning might have saved us all, mind you.
Narration/&NightAttack_10_Selfpres_Normal	Text	He just wants us to think he's a friend.
Narration/&NightAttack_11_Selfpres_Formal	Text	It might be an elaborate scheme to gain our trust.
Narration/&NightAttack_12_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Too far-fetched.
Narration/&NightAttack_13_Friendly_Default	Text	So what do we do?
Narration/&NightAttack_14_Friendly_Slang	Text	What's the plan, then?
Narration/&NightAttack_15_Friendly_Formal	Text	Be that as it may, what shall we do now?
Narration/&NightAttack_16_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	Back to the Council, I suppose, and see what they decided.
Narration/&NightAttack_17_Pragmatic_Formal	Text	We will return to the Council and hear what they have to say.
Narration/&NightAttack_18_Nosy_Default	Text	Or we could pay Surespell a visit.
Narration/&NightAttack2_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Ah, here you are.
Narration/&NightAttack2_2_Any_Normal	Text	Are you surprised?
Narration/&NightAttack2_3_Any_Formal	Text	Do you find our visit surprising, Master Surespell?
Narration/&NightAttack2_4_Any_Slang	Text	That's right. Surprised?
Narration/&NightAttack2_5_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Not really. I did warn you, after all. I'm glad you were careful.
Narration/&NightAttack2_6_Any_Default	Text	How did you know?
Narration/&NightAttack2_7_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Call it a hunch. 
Narration/&NightAttack2_8_Any_Slang	Text	A great, steaming pile of hunch. Got a bridge to sell, too?
Narration/&NightAttack2_9_Any_Normal	Text	Oh, really?
Narration/&NightAttack2_10_Any_Formal	Text	You can't expect us to believe that?
Narration/&NightAttack2_11_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Oh, I have friends who...gather information.
Narration/&NightAttack2_12_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	The threat felt credible. I thought it wise to share.
Narration/&NightAttack2_13_Cynical_Normal	Text	It felt real enough to us, too.
Narration/&NightAttack2_14_Cynical_Formal	Text	Real enough to leave a scar, that much is certain.
Narration/&NightAttack2_15_Selfpres_Default	Text	You know more than you're telling.
Narration/&NightAttack2_16_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Always. But I'm on your side, and that's all that matters.
Narration/&NightAttack2_17_Cynical_Normal	Text	Really? Aren't we lucky? So what other pearls of wisdom do you have to share - friend?
Narration/&NightAttack2_18_Cynical_Formal	Text	In that case, you'd be happy to advise us further, I presume?
Narration/&NightAttack2_19_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Certainly. Always drink wine at the Gravekeep's Cask. Their beer is utterly foul.
Narration/&NightAttack2_20_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	Seriously? Everyone knows that!
Narration/&NightAttack2_21_Pragmatic_Formal	Text	That's disappointing. You can do better than common knowledge, I'm sure. 
Narration/&NightAttack2_21_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	But clearly you're here for business, not small talk.
Narration/&NightAttack4_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Ah, here you are.
Narration/&NightAttack4_2_Any_Normal	Text	Are you surprised?
Narration/&NightAttack4_3_Any_Formal	Text	Do you find our visit surprising, Master Surespell?
Narration/&NightAttack4_4_Any_Slang	Text	That's right. Surprised?
Narration/&NightAttack4_3_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Not at all, since you followed my...advice.
Narration/&NightAttack4_4_Any_Default	Text	How do you know that?
Narration/&NightAttack4_5_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	You're here, alive and unwounded.
Narration/&NightAttack4_6_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	I heard there was some disturbance at the residence.
Narration/&NightAttack4_7_Any_Default	Text	Is that so?
Narration/&NightAttack3_1_CaptainIronshell_NPC	Text	Senior deputies!
Narration/&NightAttack3_2_Friendly_Default	Text	Captain! What's the news?
Narration/&NightAttack3_3_CaptainIronshell_NPC	Text	You didn't hear?
Narration/&NightAttack3_4_CaptainIronshell_NPC	Text	Your quarters at the residence were ransacked!
Narration/&NightAttack3_5_Nosy_Default	Text	What? When?
Narration/&NightAttack3_6_CaptainIronshell_NPC	Text	During the night. It's lucky you weren't there.
Narration/&NightAttack3_7_Cynical_Formal	Text	Eh. We could have handled a burglar or two.
Narration/&NightAttack3_8_Cynical_Normal	Text	No doubt we would have seen the villains off, had we been there.
Narration/&NightAttack3_9_CaptainIronshell_NPC	Text	They were more than simple burglars, to infiltrate the palace undetected.
Narration/&NightAttack3_10_Nosy_Default	Text	Who, then?
Narration/&NightAttack3_11_CaptainIronshell_NPC	Text	I can't say for sure but...
Narration/&NightAttack3_12_CaptainIronshell_NPC	Text	Some are saying...Sorr-Akkath.
Narration/&NightAttack3_13_Selfpres_Formal	Text	That's a worrying prospect, captain.
Narration/&NightAttack3_14_Selfpres_Slang	Text	So much for palace security, then. Thanks a lot!
Narration/&NightAttack3_15_Selfpres_Normal	Text	We were supposed to be safe there, remember?
Narration/&NightAttack3_16_CaptainIronshell_NPC	Text	I'm well aware. We have put further magical security measures in place.
Narration/&NightAttack3_17_Friendly_Default	Text	Good to know.
Narration/&NightAttack3_18_Friendly_Normal	Text	Thanks for the heads-up, captain.
Narration/&NightAttack3_19_Friendly_Formal	Text	Thank you for keeping us informed, captain.
Narration/&NightAttack3_20_CaptainIronshell_NPC	Text	You are most welcome.
Narration/&NightAttack3_21_CaptainIronshell_NPC	Text	Good day to you, senior deputies.
Narration/&NightAttack3_22_Nosy_Normal	Text	So he told the truth, that Heddlon.
Narration/&NightAttack3_23_Nosy_Formal	Text	It appears, Heddlon Surespell was right.
Narration/&NightAttack3_24_Pragmatic_Default	Text	He knew, but how?
Narration/&NightAttack3_25_Selfpres_Normal	Text	He's a spy, or something similar.
Narration/&NightAttack3_26_Selfpres_Formal	Text	I'm pretty sure he's Imperial Intelligence.
Narration/&NightAttack3_27_Selfpres_Slang	Text	The guy is a spook, it's practically written on his face.
Narration/&NightAttack3_28_Pragmatic_Default	Text	He looks normal to me.
Narration/&NightAttack3_29_Logical_Default	Text	That's what spies do. 
Narration/&NightAttack3_30_Friendly_Default	Text	So, what do we do?
Narration/&NightAttack3_31_Friendly_Slang	Text	So - now what?
Narration/&NightAttack3_32_Friendly_Formal	Text	We must decide on our next move.
Narration/&NightAttack3_33_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	Back to the Council, I suppose, and see what they decided.
Narration/&NightAttack3_34_Pragmatic_Formal	Text	We will return to the Council and hear what they have to say.
Narration/&NightAttack3_35_Nosy_Default	Text	Or we could pay Surespell a visit.
Narration/&Council5_1_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Honorable delegates, please be seated!
Narration/&Council5_2_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	The Legacy Council is now in session!
Narration/&Council5_3_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Chancellor Gormsdottir has the floor.
Narration/&Council5_4_Gormsdottir_NPC	Text	Thank you, Protector.
Narration/&Council5_5_Gormsdottir_NPC	Text	Honourable Council members, we've seen Soraks in the palace - and their god Sorr-Tarr has other followers, too. 
Narration/&Council5_6_Gormsdottir_NPC	Text	It's clear the Crown is not safe. The Antiquarians' Guild moves that the Crown be taken to a place of safety.
Narration/&Council5_7_Gormsdottir_NPC	Text	While the deputies search for the remaining gems…
Narration/&Council5_8_Gormsdottir_NPC	Text	..the Council will study the Crown and decide how it may best be used.
Narration/&Council5_9_Gormsdottir_NPC	Text	The Guild proposes that the Council vote on this matter immediately.
Narration/&Council5_10_Crownbearer_Default	Text	You can't!
Narration/&Council5_11_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	You will wait for your turn to speak, senior deputy!
Narration/&Council5_12_Crownbearer_Default	Text	We searched the Badlands for these gems, and now you're just taking the Crown away from us?
Narration/&Council5_13_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Order!
Narration/&Council5_14_Danantar_NPC	Text	We are all well aware of your reservations, and we understand them.
Narration/&Council5_15_Danantar_NPC	Text	Yet, from what I heard, all parties have agreed that you should comply...
Narration/&Council5_16_Danantar_NPC	Text	...for the security of all.
Narration/&Council5_17_Crownbearer_Default	Text	Security? You talk of security?
Narration/&Council5_18_Crownbearer_Default	Text	What security? Just last night, Soraks attacked our quarters in the residence!
Narration/&Council5_19_Faisech_NPC	Text	What?
Narration/&Council5_20_Sunblaze_NPC	Text	Soraks? Here in Caer Cyflen?
Narration/&Council5_21_Danantar_NPC	Text	In the palace?
Narration/&Council5_22_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Order!
Narration/&Council5_23_Sunblaze_NPC	Text	Immediate action is needed!
Narration/&Council5_24_Danantar_NPC	Text	Well, find the damned Soraks, then!
Narration/&Council5_25_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Please, my lords!
Narration/&Council5_26_Danantar_NPC	Text	Where are your paladins?
Narration/&Council5_27_Sunblaze_NPC	Text	Where are your wizards and their divination spells?
Narration/&Council5_28_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Stop it!
Narration/&Council5_29_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	None of this is helping!
Narration/&Council5_30_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Lord Sunblaze, you're supposed to be neutral, here!
Narration/&Council5_31_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Someone must introduce a formal request.
Narration/&Council5_32_Danantar_NPC	Text	Right. Apologies.
Narration/&Council5_33_Danantar_NPC	Text	You're right, let's vote. Only senior members, please.
Narration/&Council5_34_Danantar_NPC	Text	Those for securing the Crown, say aye.
Narration/&Council5_35_Gormsdottir_Default	Text	Aye.
Narration/&Council5_36_Faisech_NPC	Text	Aye.
Narration/&Council5_37_Danantar_NPC	Text	Aye.
Narration/&Council5_38_Keenmind_Default	Text	...nay.
Narration/&Council5_39_Sunblaze_NPC	Text	Nay.
Narration/&Council5_40_Danantar_NPC	Text	Well, we have a majority.
Narration/&Council5_41_Sunblaze_NPC	Text	Well help you with the...attunement issue.
Narration/&Council5_42_Faisech_NPC	Text	Wait! Who's going to take the Crown, and where?
Narration/&Council5_43_Danantar_NPC	Text	Well, the most secure location would be...
Narration/&Council5_44_Danantar_NPC	Text	...the temple of Einar, of course. The Hearth.
Narration/&Council5_45_Faisech_NPC	Text	Of course - right here in Caer Cyflen!
Narration/&Council5_46_Faisech_NPC	Text	Neutral ground, of course, but still the Principality of Masgarth is the center of Solasta!
Narration/&Council5_47_Danantar_NPC	Text	Do you have a better idea, Dean Faisech?
Narration/&Council5_48_Faisech_NPC	Text	We have secure locations, too!
Narration/&Council5_49_Danantar_NPC	Text	How many high-ranking paladins in your Tower, Faisech?
Narration/&Council5_50_Faisech_NPC	Text	More than actual wizards in your school!
Narration/&Council5_51_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Order!
Narration/&Council5_52_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Remember the dignity of your positions, my lords!
Narration/&Council5_53_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Senior deputies - if you please? The Council has spoken.
Narration/&Council5_54_Choice_Pragmatic_WRITTEN	Text	This is a mistake.
Narration/&Council5_55_Choice_Mean_WRITTEN	Text	You're all stupid!
Narration/&Council5_56_Choice_Lawful_WRITTEN	Text	We must obey the council...
Narration/&Council5_57_Choice_Selfpres_WRITTEN	Text	Someone here is a traitor!
Narration/&Council5_58_Choice_Pragmatic_Default	Text	This is a mistake. We are bound to the Crown.
Narration/&Council5_59_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	You are sworn deputies. You must comply.
Narration/&Council5_60_Choice_Mean_Default	Text	The Council doesn't deserve the Crown - you just proved that!
Narration/&Council5_61_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	Surrender the Crown, as the Council orders.
Narration/&Council5_62_Choice_Lawful_Default	Text	We serve the Council.
Narration/&Council5_63_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	And you shall be commended, senior deputies.
Narration/&Council5_64_Choice_Selfpres_Default	Text	You keep bickering instead of looking for the traitor among you!
Narration/&Council5_65_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	This is a grave accusation, senior deputy.
Narration/&Council5_66_Authority_Default	Text	How could they?
Narration/&Council5_67_Pragmatic_Default	Text	It can't end like this!
Narration/&Council5_68_Crownbearer_Default	Text	I can hear it calling!
Narration/&Council5_69_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	Senior deputies, please, a word?
Narration/&Council5_70_Authority_Default	Text	Summer? What do you want? 
Narration/&Council5_71_Authority_Default	Text	Your chancellor led the charge against us in there.
Narration/&Council5_72_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	I'm truly sorry. But, I have some information that might interest you.
Narration/&Council5_73_Selfpres_Default	Text	I doubt it.
Narration/&Council5_74_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	It's about the secret cult of Arivad.
Narration/&Council5_75_Nosy_Default	Text	What?
Narration/&Council5_76_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	I admit, this is second-hand intelligence, but still...
Narration/&Council5_77_Authority_Default	Text	Speak up.
Narration/&Council5_78_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	One of my people saw a man with a tattoo...
Narration/&Council5_79_Selfpres_Default	Text	The letter A?
Narration/&Council5_80_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	Yes. He followed the man all day, and to gathering that night...
Narration/&Council5_81_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	...in a remote village to the South.
Narration/&Council5_82_Authority_Default	Text	What village?
Narration/&Council5_83_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	It's called Earcorn. Very small...
Narration/&Council5_84_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	...but you'll find it easily on any local map.
Narration/&Council5_85_Friendly_Default	Text	Thank you, Halman.
Narration/&Council5_86_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	You're welcome. Someone must take care of these cultists.
Narration/&Council5_87_HalmanSummer_NPC	Text	And the Council...well, you know.
Narration/&Council5_88_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Yes, we do.
Narration/&Council5_After_1_BericSunblaze_NPC	Text	I'm so sorry.
Narration/&Council5_After_2_Friendly_Default	Text	Why? You didn't betray us.
Narration/&Council5_After_3_BericSunblaze_NPC	Text	I understand how they see things, but…
Narration/&Council5_After_4_Selfpres_Normal	Text	Something's wrong with the Council.
Narration/&Council5_After_5_Selfpres_Slang	Text	The Council's rotten.
Narration/&Council5_After_6_BericSunblaze_NPC	Text	The Council's still young. Everyone is angling for influence…
Narration/&Council5_After_7_BericSunblaze_NPC	Text	…but squabbling academics are better than clashing armies.
Narration/&Council5_After_8_Nosy_Default	Text	Only Airgetine supported us? I mean, beside you.
Narration/&Council5_After_9_Selfpres_Default	Text	Why would the New Empire be the only friend we have in there?
Narration/&Council5_After_10_BericSunblaze_NPC	Text	Airgetine's a moderate, it's true, but the New Empire is subtle. Plans within plans.
Narration/&Council5_After_11_BericSunblaze_NPC	Text	It's hard to say whether he was following orders or voting his conscience.
Narration/&Council5_After_12_BericSunblaze_NPC	Text	I wouldn't read too much into his vote, at least for now. 
Narration/&Council5_After_13_BericSunblaze_NPC	Text	It didn't change anything, anyway.
Narration/&Council5_After_14_BericSunblaze_NPC	Text	But what about you? How are you coping without the Crown?
Narration/&Council5_After_15_Crownbearer_Default	Text	Better than I expected.
Narration/&Council5_After_16_Any2_Default	Text	Same for me, actually. It almost feels like we still have the Crown.
Narration/&Council5_After_17_Any3_Default	Text	Exactly. We lost its magical power, but…
Narration/&Council5_After_18_Any2_Default	Text	…the voice is still calling.
Narration/&Council5_After_19_BericSunblaze_NPC	Text	Interesting. So the attunement is unaffected by physical separation?
Narration/&Council5_After_20_Friendly_Any	Text	Keep the Crown safe, Marshal, will you, please?
Narration/&Council5_After_21_BericSunblaze_NPC	Text	You have my word.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_1_Merton_NPC	Text	Hey, you!
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_2_Cynical_Default	Text	Not drowning in your beer, today, Arwin?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_3_Merton_NPC	Text	No, wait!
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_4_Merton_NPC	Text	They took the Crown from you?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_5_Selfpres_Default	Text	How do you know that?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_6_Merton_NPC	Text	How? You really think I'm just a drunk?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_7_Merton_NPC	Text	The whole Principality knows you have that Crown.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_8_Merton_NPC	Text	I mean had.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_9_Cynical_Normal	Text	Yeah.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_10_Cynical_Formal	Text	Indeed.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_11_Merton_NPC	Text	Something's not right.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_12_Cynical_Normal	Text	You think we need you to tell us?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_13_Merton_NPC	Text	I mean something's up - something big.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_14_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	What, exactly?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_15_Merton_NPC	Text	They're here.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_16_Selfpres_Default	Text	Who? The Soraks?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_17_Merton_NPC	Text	Not them. Their pawns.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_18_Lawful_Default	Text	You're drunk.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_19_Merton_NPC	Text	What's wrong with you? 
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_20_Merton_NPC	Text	Haven't you seen enough?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_21_Merton_NPC	Text	Didn't you see what they can do? 
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_22_Merton_NPC	Text	To people?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_23_Merton_NPC	Text	At first I thought you were just another bunch of brainless Council lackeys...
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_24_Merton_NPC	Text	...but you've seen their ways.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_25_Merton_NPC	Text	At Coparran, and plenty other places, I'm sure.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_26_Merton_NPC	Text	The way they get into people's heads.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_27_Merton_NPC	Text	I've watched the people of Caer Cyflen for ten years.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_28_Merton_NPC	Text	I've felt a change - slow, subtle...
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_29_Merton_NPC	Text	...until now. It's getting stronger!
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_30_Merton_NPC	Text	I can't let them win.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_31_Cynical_Default	Text	So what? You're ready to become a hero again?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_32_Merton_NPC	Text	I can still fight.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_33_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Are you offering to join us?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_34_Merton_NPC	Text	You brought back my sword.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_35_Merton_NPC	Text	That blade and I, we've slain countless abominations down there in the Badlands.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_36_Merton_NPC	Text	You helped me get closure for my lost child.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_37_Merton_NPC	Text	You were at my side when we took down the remorhaz.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_38_Merton_NPC	Text	Yes, I'd like to join you.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_39_Choice_WRITTEN	Text	Fine.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_40_Choice_WRITTEN	Text	No.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_41_Agreed_Default	Text	Fine, come with us.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_42_Refused_Default	Text	You're useless!
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_43_Refused_Merton	Text	And you're stupid!
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_44_Agreed_Merton	Text	Ha ha! Now you're talking!
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_1_Authority_Default	Text	This is it? Earcorn!
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_2_Merton_NPC	Text	Look, a farm! And another! High adventure - I love it!
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_3_Cynical_Normal	Text	This doesn't exactly feel like the headquarters for a massive invasion.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_4_Cynical_Slang	Text	Some headquarters. Dark cults used to be better.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_5_Cynical_Formal	Text	Not exactly how  I imagined the lair of evil Sorr-Akkath worshippers.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_6_Pragmatic_Default	Text	But it could be hiding a small group of infiltrators.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_7_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Still, a good cover for cunning infiltrators.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_8_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	Let's look around for anything suspicious.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_9_Pragmatic_Formal	Text	Let us examine the area in search of clues.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_10_Cynical_Default	Text	No tavern? That's suspicious, for a start.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_11_Merton_NPC	Text	That was my line!
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_12_Authority_Slang	Text	Shut up! We're trying to be stealthy!
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_13_Authority_Normal	Text	You'd better be quiet if you don't want us to be spotted.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_14_Authority_Format	Text	Quiet, if you please. Let discretion be our watchword.
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_1_Any_Default	Text	I have something!
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_2_Cynical_Default	Text	Footprints? Really? It's a village. People live here.
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_3_Cynical_Default	Text	Random footprints in a village? Not much of a clue.
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_4_Merton_NPC	Text	Your villagers have claws.
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_5_Any_Default	Text	Your villagers have claws.
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_6_Selfpres_Default	Text	Soraks?
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_7_Authority_Default	Text	This is it! Be ready for anything.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_1_Pragmatic_Default	Text	That didn't feel like we surprised them.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_2_Violent_Default	Text	Because we didn't.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_3_Selfpres_Default	Text	This was a trap.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_4_Merton_NPC	Text	Yep, carefully set up to kill us - well, you, I guess.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_5_Selfpres_Default	Text	Halman Summer?
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_6_Pragmatic_Default	Text	He said the intelligence wasn't certain.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_7_Merton_NPC	Text	The Antiquarian? He told you about this place?
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_8_Violent_Default	Text	He's a traitor!
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_9_Nosy_Default	Text	A Sorak in disguise?
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_10_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Or just one of their agents.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_11_Merton_NPC	Text	Or just one of their agents.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_12_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Anyone checked him for a tattoo?
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_13_Violent_Default	Text	There's only one way to know for sure.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_14_Authority_Default	Text	Let's go back to Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_1_Selfpres_Normal	Text	What's going on?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_1_Selfpres_Formal	Text	What is all this?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_2_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Is that the army? In the city?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_3_Violent_Default	Text	Let's find Summer!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_4_Pragmatic_Default	Text	I'd prefer to find Carran first.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_5_Merton_NPC	Text	I have to check on someone. I'll catch you later.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_6_Nosy_Default	Text	Check on who?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_7_Nosy_Default	Text	I thought he had no friends left.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_8_Cynical_Default	Text	His brewer, maybe?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_1_Any_Normal	Text	Hello, Karel! Have you seen Lord Carran?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_1_Any_Slang	Text	Hey, Karel! Seen Carran around?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_1_Any_Formal	Text	Greetings, master Martel. Have you seen lord Carran recently?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_2_KarelMartel_NPC	Text	Not since the conscription.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_3_Any_Default	Text	Conscription? Is that what's happening?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_4_KarelMartel_NPC	Text	I know, it's been in the air, but now...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_5_KarelMartel_NPC	Text	...rumors has it that Gallivan's armies are massing at the eastern border.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_6_Any_Default	Text	Gallivan? Why?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_7_KarelMartel_NPC	Text	Ask your friends on the Council. They were supposed to keep the peace.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar1_Any_Default	Text	Robar? You've been drafted?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar2_Robar_NPC	Text	Don't be ridiculous - I enlisted! Gets me the rank I deserve. Finally.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar3_Any_Default	Text	Captain? That's even higher than Beryl Stonebeard.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar4_Robar_NPC	Text	I'd rather forget that time, fighting Soraks in that hellhole Caer Lem.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar5_Any_NPC	Text	Is war really better?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar6_Sellsword_Default	Text	Can't disagree.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar7_Robar_NPC	Text	Gallivan's armies are honest foes - flesh, blood, and steel.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar8_Any_NPC	Text	If you say so.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar9_Any_NPC	Text	Be safe, Robar.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar10_Sellsword_Default	Text	To the bitter end, brother.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar11_Robar_Default	Text	To the bitter end.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar12_Robar_Default	Text	You too.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl1_Any_NPC	Text	Beryl? What's going on?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl1_Highclass_Default	Text	Lady Stonebeard, what is happening?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl2_Beryl_NPC	Text	You still here? I suppose we owe this mess to you?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl3_Any_Default	Text	What mess?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl4_Beryl_NPC	Text	War. Or the threat of war.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl5_Any_Default	Text	We didn't do anything!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl6_Beryl_NPC	Text	Well, the Snow Alliance representatives are leaving.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl7_Beryl_NPC	Text	We don't want to be caught between Masgarth and Gallivan.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl8_Any_Default	Text	How about maintaining peace?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl9_Beryl_NPC	Text	I did my part. Didn't work.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl10_Any_Default	Text	When are you leaving?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl11_Beryl_NPC	Text	As soon as my dawdling cousin gives the order.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl12_Beryl_NPC	Text	Let's hope we can meet again, on the same side.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl13_Any_NPC	Text	Farewell, Beryl.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl14_Highclass_Default	Text	Good luck, my lady.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl15_Beryl_NPC	Text	Cut the 'my' lady stuff, will you?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat1_Any_Default	Text	Daliat! What's going on?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat2_Daliat_NPC	Text	Well, I'd rather not say.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat3_Any_Default	Text	Always secretive.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat4_Spy_Default	Text	Do we still need to play this game?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat5_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Oh, hello.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat6_Any_Default	Text	Heddlon Surespell, what a surprise.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat7_Spy_Default	Text	Are you two related?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat8_Daliat_NPC	Text	He's my superior.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat9_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Two ranks above.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat10_Daliat_Default	Text	Right.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat11_Spy_NPC	Text	So, you two are spies?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat12_HeddlonSurespell_Default	Text	Such a crude word.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat13_Daliat_NPC	Text	We prefer the old name: 'Silent Whisper.'
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat14_Lawful_Default	Text	The intelligence service of the Manacalon Empire? Really?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat15_Daliat_NPC	Text	Nicer than 'spies.'
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat16_Authority_Default	Text	So, what's in there?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat17_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Nothing and no one, I'm afraid.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat18_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	I was looking for your...acquaintance, Halman Summer.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat19_Violent_Default	Text	Oh, him?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat20_Violent_Default	Text	We were looking for him, too.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat21_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	I'm afraid he's gone.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat22_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Isn't everybody leaving?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat23_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	The Antiquarians and the other Snow Alliance people are pulling out.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat24_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	The Antiquarians are still packing up, though.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat25_Pragmatic_Default	Text	He sent after a lead...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat26_Selfpres_Default	Text	...or rather, into a trap.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat27_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	I'm not surprised.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat28_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	We had eyes on him, but...we lost him.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat29_Selfpres_Default	Text	Is he that good?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat30_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Or he had help. Magical.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat31_Selfpres_NPC	Text	Soraks?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat32_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	Who knows?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat33_Pragmatic_NPC	Text	What triggered all this ?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat34_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	You should really get to the Council.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat35_HeddlonSurespell_NPC	Text	They'll tell you everything.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_1_Carran_NPC	Text	In Maraike's name! You're here!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_Any_Default	Text	What is happening?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_3_Carran_NPC	Text	The whole delegation from the Tower of Knowledge - they were poisoned!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_4_Nosy_Default	Text	Poisoned? How many died?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_5_Carran_NPC	Text	All of them, thirty-something, but that's not the point.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_6_Carran_NPC	Text	After Dean Faisech accused the Council of...favoritism toward the Principality...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_7_Carran_NPC	Text	...for keeping the Crown in Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_8_Pragmatic_Default	Text	At the temple of Einar, which is not affiliated with the Principality.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_9_Carran_NPC	Text	I know that, of course.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_10_Carran_NPC	Text	Yet, soon after, we all ate at the same table, but the Tower delegates died in their sleep.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_11_Carran_NPC	Text	Of course, Gallivan took it as an attack by the Principality.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_12_Pragmatic_Default	Text	But that's why the Tower's on the Council, and not Gallivan's government - to avoid exactly that!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_13_Carran_NPC	Text	You think I don't know that?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_14_Carran_NPC	Text	This is real politics, my friends - diplomacy is dead.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_15_Cynical_Default	Text	So the Legacy Council was a sham all along?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_16_Carran_NPC	Text	No! It was a real, honest effort to maintain peace.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_17_Cynical_Default	Text	And it failed.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_18_Carran_NPC	Text	We're not at war yet.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_19_Pragmatic_Default	Text	But Gallivan's massing troops at the border.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_20_Carran_NPC	Text	Bad news really does travel fast.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_21_Carran_NPC	Text	Anyway, pressure is growing for the Princess to...intervene.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_22_Cynical_Default	Text	Her? How?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_23_Carran_NPC	Text	Not as member of the Council. As head of state.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_24_Carran_NPC	Text	But tell me, where were you now that your quest is...well...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_25_Authority_Default	Text	Chasing the Soraks and their pawns.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_26_Cynical_Default	Text	Unsuccessfully.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_27_Violent_Default	Text	Halman Summer might have been one of them.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_28_Carran_NPC	Text	What? The man was...I mean, I dined at his mansion recently...he...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_29_Nosy_Default	Text	Where?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_30_Carran_NPC	Text	Where what?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_31_Authority_Default	Text	A mansion? He told us he lived at the Snow Alliance embassy.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_32_Carran_NPC	Text	No - his family has a mansion in town.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_33_Carran_NPC	Text	Oddly, it's right next door to the Circle of Danantar's headquarters.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_34_Authority_Default	Text	We need to go there.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_35_Carran_NPC	Text	I might need you when you're done with this errand.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad1_Authority_Normal	Text	Is that it?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad2_Authority_Formal	Text	Is this the place?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad3_Nosy_Normal	Text	I don't see a sign, or a coat of arms, or anything.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad4_Nosy_Formal	Text	Nothing to say this is Halman Summer's residence.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad5_Spy_Normal	Text	Not bad for a secret home.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad6_Spy_Slang	Text	He's no dummy.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad7_Pragmatic_Formal	Text	And close to official buildings - who would suspect anything?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad8_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	Hiding in plain sight - classic.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad9_Spy_Default	Text	Let's go around. Maybe find a window and get inside.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad10_Lawful_Default	Text	We should obtain a warrant.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad11_Pragmatic_Default	Text	We're past that, don't you think?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad12_Violent_Default	Text	Since I intend to kill him, I believe we are.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad13_Spy_Default	Text	Come on - they're all preparing for war, no one's paying attention.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside1_Any_Normal	Text	This place is...insane.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside2_Any_Formal	Text	Truly, a den of madness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside3_Religion_Maraike_Default	Text	Holy Maraike...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside4_Religion_Einar_Default	Text	Einar protect us all...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside5_Religion_Arun_Default	Text	In the name of Arun, this place is unthinkable!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside6_Religion_Pakri_Default	Text	Pakri be with us, we have found our enemy!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside7_Lawful_Default	Text	In the middle of Caer Cyflen! How could they. . ?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside8_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Dissimulation is their creed.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside9_Violent_Default	Text	This ends now. Let's kill them all!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside10_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Maybe they have the gems.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded1_Friendly_Normal	Text	Hey - I've seen this man at the Gravekeep's Cask!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded_Friendly_Formal	Text	I know that face! He was at the Gravekeep's cask.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded2_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	They're all from town!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded3_EinarAuthority_Normal	Text	Corrupted by the Soraks!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded4_Selfpres_Normal	Text	For years, maybe. They were preparing.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded5_Greed_Normal	Text	There's a ton of paperwork here.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded6_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	A lot's been burned, though.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded7_Greed_Normal	Text	No sign of the gems.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded8_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	Look at this - a map of the Badlands.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded9_Nosy_Normal	Text	What are these places?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded10_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	Everywhere we've been...and some other places.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded11_Greed_Normal	Text	The gems...all eight of them.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded12_Nosy_Normal	Text	And this?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded13_History_Normal	Text	Probably the location of the Rift.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded14_History_Normal	Text	It's in the Aer-Elai, the heart of Manacalon. Where the capital was.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded15_Nosy_Normal	Text	And this?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded16_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	No idea.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded17_Carver_Normal	Text	Not a dwarf rune.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded18_Greed_Normal	Text	I have a list of names.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded19_Greed_Normal	Text	Some are marked 'converted,' some 'resilient,' and some 'prospects.'
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded20_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	There's a whole book of names here!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded21_Lawful_Normal	Text	We must take this to the authorities!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded22_Helpful_Normal	Text	There will be civil war if we do. People will kill their neighbors!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded23_Violent_Normal	Text	War is coming whatever we do.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_1_Player_Normal	Text	Carran!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_2_Player_Formal	Text	Lord Carran!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_3_Carran_NPC	Text	This isn't a good time.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_4_Player_Normal	Text	We're aware - the city's full of Sorak pawns!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_5_Player_Formal	Text	Indeed, and we have proof of an imminent Sorak attack!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_6_Carran_NPC	Text	Surely you exaggerate!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_7_Player_Normal	Text	Here! A list of all those under or soon to be under Sorak influence.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_8_Carran_NPC	Text	What? Where did you find this?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_9_Player_Normal	Text	Halman Summer's mansion. He was one of them!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_10_Carran_NPC	Text	I can't believe it...all this time...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_11_Player_Normal	Text	There's more!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_12_Player_Normal	Text	Everything suggests that the Soraks have the two missing gems.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_13_Player_Normal	Text	They had a map showing everywhere we found gems, plus two other places.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_14_Carran_NPC	Text	Maraike's mercy!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_15_Carran_NPC	Text	We must convene the Council, but... this really isn't the best time.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_16_Player_Normal	Text	The Gallivan situation, I suppose?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_17_Player_Slang	Text	Gallivan, eh? How it is going?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_18_Carran_NPC	Text	All the city's clerics are working to resurrect the victims. I hope it's enough.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_19_Greed_Default	Text	More than thirty? That's a lot of diamonds. And clerics.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_20_Carran_NPC	Text	We didn't really have a choice. The Crown is going to pay.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_21_Greed_Default	Text	What?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_22_Carran_NPC	Text	The envoy from Gallivan was...adamant.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_23_Carran_NPC	Text	The Princess took command of the situation...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_24_Carran_NPC	Text	...and told him Masgarth would pay to resurrect their people.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_25_Pragmatic_Default	Text	So why the troops at the border?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_26_Carran_NPC	Text	Let's call it...an incentive.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_27_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Everything should be fine, then.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_28_Pragmatic_Default	Text	The Principality resurrects the poison victims, Gallivan withdraws its troops.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_29_Carran_NPC	Text	Let's hope so. We don't have any idea who's behind this.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_30_Carran_NPC	Text	Though your little book of secrets here might help us with that.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_31_Violent_Default	Text	So, the Principality is still drafting soldiers.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_32_Carran_NPC	Text	To defend the city. 
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_33_Carran_NPC	Text	The army left for the border as soon as we heard about the threat.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_34_Cynical_Default	Text	So much for confidence.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_35_Carran_NPC	Text	Smiles work better if you have a sword at your side.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_36_Greed_Default	Text	So you're resurrecting Faisech?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_37_Greed_Default	Text	How much is that? A thousand gold pieces?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_38_Carran_NPC	Text	I know what you're going to say. So don't.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_39_Cynical_Default	Text	And someone must pray for his soul... Imagine that!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_40_Carran_NPC	Text	Marshal Sunblaze is taking care of the senior delegates personally.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_41_Selfpres_Default	Text	Wait a minute!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_42_Selfpres_Default	Text	Where is this happening?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_43_Carran_NPC	Text	In the temple of Einar. You've been in their dispensary...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_44_Carran_NPC	Text	Wait, you don't...they died!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_45_Selfpres_Default	Text	You think they'd stop at that?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_46_Pragmatic_NPC	Text	Thirty-something people inside the most secure place in the Principality...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_47_Pragmatic_NPC	Text	More than thirty possible traitors in the most protected temple in the Principality...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_48_Violent_NPC	Text	...close to the Crown of the Magister?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_49_Carran_NPC	Text	No! No, no, no!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_50_Authority_NPC	Text	What are we waiting for?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_1_Authority_Default	Text	Marshal!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_2_BericSunblaze_NPC	Text	Greetings, friends!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_3_Authority_Default	Text	Where are the delegates?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_4_BericSunblaze_NPC	Text	In the dispensary.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_5_BericSunblaze_NPC	Text	What's going on?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_6_Friendly_Default	Text	Are you all right?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_7_BericSunblaze_NPC	Text	I just cast a resurrection spell...forgive me - it is rather draining.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_8_BericSunblaze_NPC	Text	Wait!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_9_Cynical_Normal	Text	Feeling good, dead people?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_10_Cynical_Formal	Text	Alright, everyone, we know who you are.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_11_SorakAgent_NPC	Text	Attack!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_1_BericSunblaze_NPC	Text	By Einar...Sorak agents, in the temple!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_2_Authority_Default	Text	Where's the Crown?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_3_BericSunblaze_NPC	Text	Take this key. I...can't run.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_4_BericSunblaze_NPC	Text	Follow the light!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_5_Authority_Default	Text	Let's go!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_1_Authority_Default	Text	There!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_2_Selfpres_Default	Text	It's gone!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_3_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Here! A secret passage?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_4_Selfpres_Default	Text	In the middle of the Temple?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_5_Authority_Default	Text	How did they miss that?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_6_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Doesn't matter now!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_7_Pragmatic_Default	Text	This is ancient - from the first centuries after the Cataclysm!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_8_Pragmatic_Default	Text	No time for a history lesson!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_7_Any_Default	Text	They went this way!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_1_Any_Default	Text	The city's Imperial Gate!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_2_Any_Default	Text	They're here!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_3_Any_Default	Text	They're trying to get away with the Crown!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_4_Any_Default	Text	Protector!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_5_LeiraKean_NPC	Text	We failed! They got away with it!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_6_Any_Default	Text	No!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_7_Merton_NPC	Text	They must not destroy the gate!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_8_Any_Default	Text	It's not over! They must not destroy the gate!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_9_Merton_NPC	Text	There's too many of them!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple9_Merton_NPC	Text	Come on! Fight!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple5_1_Any_Default	Text	Look!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple5_2_Any_Default	Text	The Princess?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple5_3_Merton_NPC	Text	Ha, ha, ha! Come on, old lady - time to show off!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple5_4_Princess_NPC	Text	One day, Arwin Merton...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter1_Princess_NPC	Text	Don't look at me like that.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter2_Any_Default	Text	Your royal highness...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter3_Princess_NPC	Text	...thank you is what you're looking for.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter4_Any_Default	Text	Thank you.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter5_Pragmatic_Default	Text	They took the Crown.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter6_Princess_NPC	Text	Is this...evil god coming?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter7_Authority_Default	Text	I suppose that's their plan.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter8_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Can we follow them? 
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter9_Selfpres_Default	Text	There's no way to know where they're gone.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter10_Selfpres_Default	Text	There are so many gates.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter11_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Close to the Rift, right? Where it all began?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter12_Authority_Default	Text	No one knows exactly where the Rift was.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter13_Merton_NPC	Text	In the Aer-Elai, near the capital of Manacalon - but it's a vast area!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter14_Pragmatic_Default	Text	They must have scouted it and found a teleporter nearby.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter15_Selfpres_Default	Text	So we're doomed?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter16_Authority_Default	Text	What's going on?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter17_Merton_NPC	Text	We're under attack!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter18_Merton_NPC	Text	Sleeper agents! Everywhere in the city!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter19_Princess_Default	Text	Are they so powerful, the Sorr-Akkath?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter20_History_Default	Text	Your royal highness...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter21_History_Default	Text	We found this in Halman Summer's chambers, magically concealed.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter22_History_Default	Text	Do you have any ideas?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter23_Princess_NPC	Text	This is the Sunset Peak, south of Aer-Elai. 
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter24_Princess_NPC	Text	I recognize this tower...or what's left of it.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter25_Princess_NPC	Text	There is a gate not too far away.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter26_Princess_NPC	Text	But who knows how the place looks like now?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter27_Authority_Default	Text	We're running out of time! If there is a chance to stop them...
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter28_Violent_Default	Text	They don't stand a chance against you!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter29_Princess_NPC	Text	Alas, I cannot go into the Badlands.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter30_Nosy_Default	Text	What? Why?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter31_Princess_NPC	Text	Long story short: it would kill me faster than any dark god.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter32_Princess_NPC	Text	There's no time to explain - you have to trust me.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter33_Princess_NPC	Text	Only you can save Solasta now.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter34_Selfpres_Default	Text	Us? What about all your...heroes, and all?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter35_Princess_NPC	Text	Marshal Sunblaze is weakened from casting Resurrection spells, and so are most of his clerics.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter36_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Oh...they planned this as well, didn't they?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter37_Princess_NPC	Text	All my best fighters and spellblades are on the border.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter38_Princess_NPC	Text	Protector Kean is not what she used to be.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter39_Authority_Default	Text	Merton? You coming?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter40_Princess_NPC	Text	He's staying with me. Caer Cyflen is on fire, its streets full of Sorak pawns on a murder spree.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter41_Princess_NPC	Text	The Crown needs you. I felt it, from the beginning.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter42_Princess_NPC	Text	Kaisenax's spirit calls for you to save him from the darkness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter43_Nosy_Default	Text	The Magister? You knew him?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter44_Princess_NPC	Text	You're too curious for your own good.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter45_Authority_Default	Text	So, Merton's staying.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter46_Merton_NPC	Text	Can't say no to a princess. Especially that one.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter47_Authority_Default	Text	Fine, then.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter48_Princess_NPC	Text	I can only give you a few trinkets to help you in your endeavor.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter49_Princess_NPC	Text	And my blessing.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter50_Sellsword_Default	Text	My arm is yours, Princess.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter51_Aristocrat_Default	Text	Serving you is the greatest honor, your royal highness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter52_Spy_Default	Text	You're definitely the best crowned head around.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter53_Academic_Default	Text	To think that you knew the Magister? I have so many questions!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter54_Lowlife_Default	Text	That's more than enough, Princess. We'll do your dirty work.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter55_Lawkeeper_Default	Text	We will prevail or die, your royal highness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter56_Philosopher_Default	Text	So powerful - and yet so helpless to save Solasta. Fascinating.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter57_AcolyteEinar_Default	Text	Einar will be with us, your royal highness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter58_AcolyteMaraike_Default	Text	Maraike will be with us in life and death.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter59_AcolyteArun_Default	Text	May Arun guide us all.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter60_AcolytePakri_Default	Text	Justice will be served, your royal highness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter61_Princess_NPC	Text	You should rest and prepare yourselves.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter62_Authority_Default	Text	Sleep, now? There's no time!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter63_Princess_NPC	Text	You really should start admitting that you don't know everything.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter64_Princess_NPC	Text	Rest now. Time will wait for you, I promise.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter65_Princess_NPC	Text	I will speak the words that will activate the gate for Sunset Peak.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter66_Princess_NPC	Text	When you are ready, step onto the gate, and fulfill your destiny.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse1_Nosy_Default	Text	Did she just...stop time?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse2_Acolyte_Default	Text	This is unnatural.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse3_Selfpres_Default	Text	I wont' be able to sleep now.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse4_Authority_Default	Text	You know what's at stake. 
Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse5_Authority_Default	Text	We'll need to be ready for anything.
Narration/&Mertonswife1_Bitterroot_NPC	Text	Damned Soraks right under our noses, eh?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_Bitterroot_NPC	Text	It's worse than I thought. I met with this fake baron more than once recently...
Narration/&Mertonswife3_Bitterroot_NPC	Text	Didn't see a difference.
Narration/&Mertonswife4_Lawful_Normal	Text	Nice to meet you, too.
Narration/&Mertonswife5_Lawful_Formal	Text	And who might you be, lady?
Narration/&Mertonswife6_Bitterroot_NPC	Text	Call me Bitterroot.
Narration/&Mertonswife7_Nosy_Formal	Text	That's a peculiar name.
Narration/&Mertonswife8_Nosy_Normal	Text	So that's not your real name?
Narration/&Mertonswife9_Bitterroot_NPC	Text	It's the only name I need.
Narration/&Mertonswife10_Bitterroot_NPC	Text	Tell me something.
Narration/&Mertonswife11_Bitterroot_NPC	Text	You're bound to the Legacy Council, right?
Narration/&Mertonswife12_Cynical_Normal	Text	I knew these badges would help eventually.
Narration/&Mertonswife13_Friendly_Normal	Text	Yes, we are. Interested in joining?
Narration/&Mertonswife14_Bitterroot_NPC	Text	Ever heard of Arwin Merton? He's probably marinating in some tavern in Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&Mertonswife15_Authority_Normal	Text	We met him.
Narration/&Mertonswife16_Bitterroot_NPC	Text	If you'd be so kind, I have something I'd like you to take back to him.
Narration/&Mertonswife17_Bitterroot_NPC	Text	A message, and a gift.
Narration/&Mertonswife18_Violent_Normal	Text	Why not go yourself?
Narration/&Mertonswife19_Bitterroot_NPC	Text	I'm not going to him. He needs to come to me.
Narration/&Mertonswife20_Helpful_Normal	Text	A personal matter?
Narration/&Mertonswife21_Helpful_Slang	Text	He cheated on you or something?
Narration/&Mertonswife22_Helpful_Formal	Text	Sounds like a sensitive topic.
Narration/&Mertonswife23_Bitterroot_NPC	Text	I'd rather not go into detail. 
Narration/&Mertonswife24_Authority_Slang	Text	What's the gift?
Narration/&Mertonswife25_Authority_Normal	Text	What do we need to take back?
Narration/&Mertonswife26_Bitterroot_NPC	Text	A longsword.
Narration/&Mertonswife27_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	Not too heavy. We could do that.
Narration/&Mertonswife28_Greed_Normal	Text	But what's the reward?
Narration/&Mertonswife29_Bitterroot_NPC	Text	Ah - real heroes!
Narration/&Mertonswife30_Bitterroot_NPC	Text	I can give you the location of a... treasure.
Narration/&Mertonswife31_Cynical_Normal	Text	Of course, everyone keeps a treasure map in their pocket, just in case...
Narration/&Mertonswife32_Bitterroot_NPC	Text	It's a Manacalon building in the Badlands.
Narration/&Mertonswife33_Bitterroot_NPC	Text	The Arcaneum wanted me to loot it.
Narration/&Mertonswife33_Bitterroot_NPC2	Text	Apparently, it was a Silent Whisper base before the Cataclysm.
Narration/&Mertonswife34_Greed_Normal	Text	Heddlon Surespell would pay a fortune for what's inside.
Narration/&Mertonswife35_Bitterroot_NPC	Text	But it's full of monsters. Too many for me.
Narration/&Mertonswife36_Friendly_Normal	Text	We could team up.
Narration/&Mertonswife37_Bitterroot_NPC	Text	I've... lost the taste for adventuring.
Narration/&Mertonswife38_Bitterroot_NPC	Text	Do we have a deal?
Narration/&Mertonswife39_Helpful_NPC	Text	Sure.
Narration/&Mertonswife40_Selfpres_NPC	Text	Not interested.
Narration/&Mertonswife41_Agree_NPC	Text	Fine, what's the message?
Narration/&Mertonswife42_Choice_Refuse	Text	Sorry. We have more important things to do.
Narration/&Mertonswife43_Choice_Accept	Text	As you wish.
Narration/&Mertonswife44_Biterroot_NPC	Text	Tell him he still owes me a child, and I'm waiting. Here, in Coparann.
Narration/&Mertonswife45_Any_Normal	Text	Alright... we'll tell him that.
Narration/&Mertonswife46_Any_Formal	Text	Fine, we'll take your message to him.
Narration/&Mertonswife47_Biterroot_NPC	Text	Thank you. Here's the blade. And the map.
Narration/&Mertonswife48_Friendly_Normal	Text	Farewell, Bitterroot.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_1_Any_Normal	Text	Hello, Arwin.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_2_Merton_NPC	Text	Arwin? We're friends now? 
Narration/&Mertonswife2_3_Merton_NPC	Text	I'll keep calling you kid, I think.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_4_Any_Normal	Text	Whatever.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_5_Any_Formal	Text	Suit yourself.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_6_Any_Normal	Text	We've been to Coparran - ring a bell?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_7_Any_Formal	Text	I suppose you know the name Coparran.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_8_Merton_NPC	Text	You bet.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_9_Any_Normal	Text	Apparently you are indebted to someone there.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_10_Any_Normal	Text	An elf ranger. She calls herself Bitterroot.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_11_Merton_NPC	Text	Really?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_12_Any_Normal	Text	Something to do with her mood, maybe.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_13_Any_Normal	Text	She said you owe her...a child.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_14_Merton_NPC	Text	She's crazy.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_15_Any_Normal	Text	We just said we'd bring the message. She's still waiting.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_16_Merton_NPC	Text	Yeah...thanks for the message.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_17_Any_Normal	Text	Want to tell us what this is about?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_18_Any_Formal	Text	Maybe you would like to share a story with us?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_19_Merton_NPC	Text	No. I don't.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_20_Any_Normal	Text	You didn't take her child away from her?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_21_Merton_NPC	Text	You're out of line. I'd step back if I were you.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_22_Any_Normal	Text	Alright. It's none of our business.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_23_Any_Normal	Text	She gave us this for you.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_24_Merton_NPC	Text	What?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_25_Merton_NPC	Text	I don't believe it!
Narration/&Mertonswife2_26_Merton_NPC	Text	She went back for it...
Narration/&Mertonswife2_27_Any_Normal	Text	Feel more like talking now?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_28_Merton_NPC	Text	Get out!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_1_Merton_NPC	Text	Hello again! I hear you're the terror of the Badlands.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_Any_Default	Text	We're getting by.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_Any_Default	Text	Did you hear about a lost god?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_Merton_NPC	Text	Sure - if you're ready to die!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_Any_Default	Text	We're not green any more, Merton.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_Merton_NPC	Text	Fine, but the Lost God? That is the stuff of legend.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_7_Merton_NPC	Text	I've met a lot of people who wanted to find that temple.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_8_Merton_NPC	Text	At first I tried to help. No one ever came back.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_9_Merton_NPC	Text	So I decided to stop talking about it.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_10_Merton_NPC	Text	I felt...well...
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_11_Any_Default	Text	Responsible for their deaths?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_12_Merton_NPC	Text	Responsible? No - they paid for their folly.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_13_Merton_NPC	Text	I just grew tired of repeating the same warning over and over.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_14_Any_Default	Text	Are we bothering you?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_15_Merton_NPC	Text	You're always bothering me.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_16_Any_Default	Text	Let's go.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_17_Merton_NPC	Text	Oh, don't be so sensitive!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_18_Merton_NPC	Text	All right - the temple is real. I've seen it.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_19_Any_Default	Text	You have?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_20_Merton_NPC	Text	It was about fifteen years ago, but yes. I did.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_21_Any_Default	Text	And you didn't raid it?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_22_Merton_NPC	Text	Well, ten of us found the place...
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_23_Merton_NPC	Text	...when I was the only one left, I came home.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_24_Any_Default	Text	The other nine died?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_25_Merton_NPC	Text	Slaughtered. All of them.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_26_Merton_NPC	Text	Still interested?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_27_Any_Default	Text	You think we're not strong enough?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_28_Merton_NPC	Text	I don't know. You're the mighty Sorak killers, after all...
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_29_Merton_NPC	Text	...maybe with me...you'd have a chance.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_30_Any_Default	Text	You'd come with us?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_31_Merton_NPC	Text	I wouldn't let anyone raid that temple without me.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_32_Merton_NPC	Text	You'd never find it, for a start.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_33_Any_Default	Text	Are you after the treasure?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_34_Merton_NPC	Text	Who says there's a treasure?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_35_Merton_NPC	Text	There's a monster - I know that.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_36_Any_NPC	Text	What is it?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_37_Merton_NPC	Text	That, I don't know.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_38_Merton_NPC	Text	I just want to be there first. I want that on my tombstone.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_39_Any_Default	Text	Fair enough.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_40_Merton_NPC	Text	It's a long trip. If you're crazy enough to go, give me some time to pack my gear.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_41_Merton_NPC	Text	I need the rest of the day. I'll wait for you here.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_42_Any_Default	Text	Sure.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_1_Authority_Normal	Text	We're ready to take on that quest, Arwin.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_2_Merton_NPC	Text	Good for you!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_3_Friendly_Normal	Text	Did you change your mind?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_4_Merton_NPC	Text	No, no. I'm ready!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_5_Merton_NPC	Text	Let's go!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_6_Lawful_Normal	Text	Hey, we're supposed to go together, remember?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_7_Merton_NPC	Text	Yeah, about that. I have to go to Coparran first.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_8_Cynical_Normal	Text	Oh - unfinished business, maybe?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_9_Merton_NPC	Text	You know exactly what business.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_10_Authority_Normal	Text	So how about the quest?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_11_Merton_NPC	Text	Your map has a location called Caer Elis.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_12_History_Normal	Text	It's just an old Manacalon name.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_13_Merton_NPC	Text	Maybe, but there is a ruin - you'll see it. It's Tirmarian.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_14_Merton_NPC	Text	I'll be waiting for you.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_15_Selfpres_Normal	Text	What if we don't come?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_16_Merton_NPC	Text	Then damn the lot of you.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_17_Authority_Normal	Text	What we get there before you do?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_18_Merton_NPC	Text	Ha, ha! As if you could!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_19_Merton_NPC	Text	See you there!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_20_Selfpres_Normal	Text	He's crazy. 
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_21_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	And we're going with him.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_1_Merton_NPC	Text	See? I told you I'd be here.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_2_Nosy_Normal	Text	What have you been doing?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_3_Merton_NPC	Text	Catching up with wildlife.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_4_Merton_NPC	Text	It used to be my thing.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_5_Cynical_Normal	Text	Camping in the Badlands? Really?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_6_Merton_NPC	Text	Yep. Shadow Tamer, they called me.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_7_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	Fine, Shadow Tamer - where's the temple?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_8_Merton_NPC	Text	Behind the mist.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_1_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	We're through the mist!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_2_Merton_NPC	Text	Don't get too cocky. This is where my friends died last time.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_3_Religion_Einar_Normal	Text	Einar will guide us.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_4_Religion_Maraike_Normal	Text	Maraike is with us.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_5_Religion_Pakri_Normal	Text	Pakri will clear our minds.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_6_Religion_Arun_Normal	Text	Arun will guide our hearts.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_7_Sellsword_Normal	Text	No pain, no gain.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_8_Selpres_Normal	Text	Thanks for the encouragement.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_9_Merton_NPC	Text	Just saying...
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_1_Selfpres_Normal	Text	We did it !
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_2_Merton_NPC	Text	Yeah, we did!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_3_Merton_NPC	Text	There's still the big one, in there!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_4_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	Sure. It's not over yet.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_5_Any_Normal	Text	This is weird. I don't recognize any of these symbols.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_6_Any_Normal	Text	Was there really a lost god?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_7_History_Normal	Text	I think I know what this was:
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_8_History_Normal	Text	A temple of Arivad!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_9_Einar_Normal	Text	Einar protect us!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_10_Any_Normal	Text	Isn't that one of the names of the Sorak god?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_11_History_Normal	Text	Not before the Cataclysm.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_12_History_Normal	Text	Arivad was fierce and just on Tirmar - a god of inquisitors.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_13_History_Normal	Text	Before he was corrupted. 
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_14_History_Normal	Text	His good side became Einar.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_15_History_Normal	Text	His bad side was absorbed by Sorr-Tarr and they became one.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_16_Einar_Normal	Text	The name of Arivad is cursed. This place is...evil.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_17_History_Normal	Text	This is just stone, transported here from Tirmar.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_18_History_Normal	Text	Whatever took place within these walls happened a millenium ago.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_19_Einar_Normal	Text	Such evil never fully disappears.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_20_Lawful_Normal	Text	Well, then - let's clean the place up!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_1_Merton_NPC	Text	Well, I must say...
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_2_Merton_NPC	Text	You're the best team I ever had.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_3_Friendly_Normal	Text	Thanks!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_4_Friendly_Formal	Text	From a living legend like you, that's a great compliment.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_5_Merton_NPC	Text	Now, it's time to take your reward.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_6_Any_Normal	Text	You're leaving?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_7_Merton_NPC	Text	I told you. This is it for me - killing that remorhaz, climbing those stairs.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_8_Merton_NPC	Text	I need to tell someone. I'll see you back at Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_9_Selfpres_Normal	Text	Mysterious.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_10_Pragmatic_Normal	Text	Crazy but...a damn good ranger.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_11_Nosy_Normal	Text	He's going back to that Bitterroot woman.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_12_Lawful_Normal	Text	That's none of our business. 
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_13_Greed_Normal	Text	Indeed. That chest on the other hand...
Narration/&TheAerElai1_Nosy_Default	Text	Look at that...
Narration/&TheAerElai2_Nosy_Default	Text	...the heart of the Badlands, almost the epicenter of the Cataclysm.
Narration/&TheAerElai3_Selfpres_Default	Text	This is a there's nothing left of the old Empire.
Narration/&TheAerElai4_Authority_Default	Text	All right, people - we're not here for the view.
Narration/&TheAerElai5_Arcana_Default	Text	This wind...it's not natural.
Narration/&TheAerElai6_Arcana_Default	Text	It's a mana wind. We can't use magic to get across.
Narration/&TheAerElai7_Cynical_Default	Text	So, falling would be a bad idea, then.
Narration/&TheAerElai8_Lawful_Default	Text	We've been through worse.
Narration/&TheAerElai9_Selfpres_Default	Text	Watch out!
Narration/&TheAerElai10_Nosy_Default	Text	What kind of creature lives in a place like this?
Narration/&TheAerElai11_Nature_Default	Text	You got it: fire spiders.
Narration/&TheAerElai12_Selfpres_Default	Text	Over there! Soraks!
Narration/&TheAerElai13_Einar_Default	Text	They don't need to hide, here.
Narration/&TheAerElai14_Pragmatic_Default	Text	They're not paying attention. What are they doing?
Narration/&TheAerElai15_Cynical_Default	Text	Dropping gigantic bones into lava?
Narration/&TheAerElai16_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Why?
Narration/&TheAerElai17_Nature_Default	Text	They're not just any bones...
Narration/&TheAerElai18_Nature_Default	Text	...those are dragon bones!
Narration/&TheAerElai19_Pragmatic_Default	Text	How many dragons died here?
Narration/&TheAerElai20_Arcana_Default	Text	Remember what the Princess said. The place is deadly to them.
Narration/&TheAerElai21_Authority_Default	Text	There's no other way - we need to get up there!
Narration/&TheAerElai22_Cynical_Default	Text	Without being shot at, preferably?
Narration/&TheAerElai23_Cynical_Default	Text	More dragon bones?
Narration/&TheAerElai24_Pragmatic_Default	Text	That's really what they were doing - cleaning up the place!
Narration/&TheAerElai25_Authority_Default	Text	They were destroying the bones!
Narration/&TheAerElai26_Nosy_Default	Text	How do you know?
Narration/&TheAerElai27_Arcana_Default	Text	The bones are a threat to them!
Narration/&TheAerElai28_Pragmatic_Default	Text	I don't follow.
Narration/&TheAerElai29_Arcana_Default	Text	These are the remains of the Masters of the Arcaneum.
Narration/&TheAerElai30_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Dragons? All of them?
Narration/&TheAerElai31_Arcana_Default	Text	The Master of Abjuration was no exception. They were all dragons.
Narration/&TheAerElai32_Arcana_Default	Text	Even the Magister.
Narration/&TheAerElai33_Arcana_Default	Text	And his bones are among those.
Narration/&TheAerElai34_Pragmatic_Default	Text	I thought I felt something, but...
Narration/&TheAerElai35_Cynical_Default	Text	Definitely.
Narration/&TheAerElai36_Authority_Default	Text	We need to search the bones.
Narration/&TheAerElai37_Any_Default	Text	Here!
Narration/&TheAerElai38_Any2_Default	Text	A tooth?
Narration/&TheAerElai39_Any3_Default	Text	It calls to me...
Narration/&TheAerElai40_Magister_NPC	Text	Let me...touch my Crown...
Narration/&TheAerElai41_Any_Default	Text	Did you hear that?
Narration/&TheAerElai42_Any2_Default	Text	I did.
Narration/&TheAerElai43_Any3_Default	Text	He wants to touch the Crown.
Narration/&TheAerElai44_Any4_Default	Text	The tooth? Just one little tooth?
Narration/&TheAerElai45_Any3_Default	Text	That's why the Soraks want to destroy the bones.
Narration/&TheAerElai46_Any2_Default	Text	What will happen if we succeed?
Narration/&TheAerElai47_Magister_NPC	Text	Let me...touch my Crown...
Narration/&TheAerElai48_Authority_Default	Text	There's only one way to find out.
Narration/&TheAerElai49_Selfpres_Default	Text	This place never ends!
Narration/&TheAerElai50_Any2_Default	Text	This is the way - I can hear the Crown!
Narration/&TheAerElai51_Any3_Default	Text	Yes! We must go on!
Narration/&TheAerElai52_Selfpres_Default	Text	Are we walking into some gigantic trap?
Narration/&TheAerElai53_Pragmatic_Default	Text	The Soraks are doing all they can to stop us!
Narration/&TheAerElai54_Authority_Default	Text	Come on - don't falter now!
Narration/&TheAerElai55_Any_Default	Text	This is it - the Rift!
Narration/&TheAerElai56_Selfpres_Default	Text	Is it open again?
Narration/&TheAerElai57_Any_Default	Text	Hard to say. 
Narration/&TheAerElai58_Any_Default	Text	I see a bunch of Soraks, but not the countless horde they're expecting.
Narration/&TheAerElai59_Cynical_Default	Text	And no god.
Narration/&TheAerElai60_Any_Default	Text	The Crown!
Narration/&TheAerElai61_Any_Default	Text	They're doing it - the damn ritual!
Narration/&TheAerElai62_Any_Default	Text	This is it, friends. This is when we make history - or die.
Narration/&TheAerElai63_AcolyteEinar_Default	Text	Einar guide us!
Narration/&TheAerElai64_AcolyteMaraike_Default	Text	Maraike watch over us!
Narration/&TheAerElai65_AcolyteArun_Default	Text	Arun lights our way!
Narration/&TheAerElai66_AcolytePakri_Default	Text	Justice will prevail!
Narration/&TheAerElai67_Highclass_Default	Text	For all my ancestors, I shall not fail!
Narration/&TheAerElai68_Sellsword_Default	Text	To the bitter end!
Narration/&TheAerElai69_Lowlife_Default	Text	Let's make this bitch pay once and for all.
Narration/&TheAerElai70_Spy_Default	Text	Let's neutralize this guy.
Narration/&TheAerElai71_Academic_Default	Text	If we were destined to fail, we would have perished already.
Narration/&TheAerElai72_Philosopher_Default	Text	We'll venture where no one has been before!
Narration/&TheAerElai73_Lawmaker_Default	Text	This chaos will end - today!
Narration/&TheAerElai74_Any_Default	Text	We did it!
Narration/&TheAerElai75_Any2_Default	Text	The Magister!
Narration/&TheAerElai76_Any2_Default	Text	He's coming back to life!
Narration/&TheAerElai77_Magister_NPC	Text	Hold.
Narration/&TheAerElai78_Any3_Default	Text	What?
Narration/&TheAerElai79_Any4_Default	Text	The Rift, it's open!
Narration/&TheAerElai80_Any3_Default	Text	No! 
Narration/&TheAerElai81_Magister_NPC	Text	HOLD.
Narration/&TheAerElai82_Any_Default	Text	I though that was it!
Narration/&TheAerElai83_Any2_Default	Text	He said hold! We need to hold!
Narration/&TheAerElai84_Any_Default	Text	Against a whole army?
Narration/&TheAerElai85_Any3_Default	Text	Look!
Narration/&TheAerElai86_Any3_Default	Text	He's closing the Rift!
Narration/&TheAerElai87_Authority_Default	Text	Protect the Magister - nothing else matters!
Narration/&TheAerElai88_Magister_NPC	Text	I was right about you.
Narration/&TheAerElai89_Magister_NPC	Text	I must go, now.
Narration/&TheAerElai90_Magister_NPC	Text	Take care of Solasta. Take care of your world.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_1_Starter_Default	Text	Hello Annie.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_2_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	You're back! How did it go?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_3_Starter_Default	Text	Well… Captain Henrik is dead, I'm sorry.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_4_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Oh. Who's in charge, then?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_5_Starter_Default	Text	You might have to wait before going to Caer Lem, I'm afraid.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_6_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	I see.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_7_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Well, not your fault. Thanks for the heads-up.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_8_Starter_Default	Text	You're welcome.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_1_Starter_Default	Text	We wanted to talk about Caer Lem.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_2_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	I'm all ears.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_3_Starter_Default	Text	No one's there anymore…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_4_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Ah, you want to claim the place?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_5_Starter_Default	Text	How does it work again?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_6_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	We go there and scavenge everything you didn't take, then you get a percentage.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_7_Starter_Default	Text	We can't promise you it's safe.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_8_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	It never is.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_9_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Once we get there, we'll set up an outpost of our own.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_10_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	I'll check with the Council first, but thanks anyway.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_11_Starter_Default	Text	What do we do next?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_12_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	Once we've done our work, I'll let you know.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_13_Quartermaster_NPC	Text	You'll just have to come by and collect your share.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_01	Text	I think… this is what the Crown showed me.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_02	Text	So, not one of the gems?
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_03	Text	Obviously.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_04	Text	Do you feel anything else?
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_05	Text	Yes.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_06	Text	Alright - let's go, then.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_07	Text	I'm afraid not.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_08	Text	That's a problem.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_09	Text	Let's go back to the Council. We have to tell them.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_1_Annie_NPC	Text	I have great need of you, my friends.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_2_Any_Default	Text	What's going on?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_3_Annie_NPC	Text	One of our teams has been attacked and is stranded in the Badlands.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_4_Any_Default	Text	Oh, where?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_5_Annie_NPC	Text	It's a bit beyond Caer Lem, not that far into the Badlands.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_6_Annie_NPC	Text	They found a legendary place - the lost city of Telema!
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_7_Annie_NPC	Text	No one really knows what it was, but the name appears in many old texts.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_8_Annie_NPC	Text	So they started exploring.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_9_Annie_NPC	Text	One of them came back yesterday...
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_10_Annie_NPC	Text	...he had lost an arm.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_11_Annie_NPC	Text	He told me they'd been attacked and his leader sent him to get help.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_12_Annie_NPC	Text	Alas, Telema is many days from here.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_13_Any_Default	Text	Do you think they're still alive?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_14_Annie_NPC	Text	I don't know, but I'd like you to go and find out.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_15_Annie_NPC	Text	If they're alive, bring them back.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_16_Annie_NPC	Text	If not... I'll send for their bodies.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_17_Annie_NPC	Text	Anyway, the place is yours to explore. I expect it contains many treasures.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_18_Any_Default	Text	Well, I suppose we can do that for our friends the Scavengers.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_19_Annie_NPC	Text	That would make you part of the family, I promise.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_20_Any_Default	Text	All right, let's hope we find them alive.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_1_Cynical_Default	Text	Good old Hector, eh?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_2_Any_Default	Text	Let's search him. We might find something to explain all this.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_3_Any_Default	Text	Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_4_Any_Default	Text	Soraks?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_5_Any_Default	Text	At least we saved two of them.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_6_Cynical_Default	Text	The best ones, I'm sure.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_7_Judgmental_Default	Text	Shut up!
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_8_Any_Default	Text	Let's go back and tell Annie.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_1_Annie_NPC	Text	My friends, you did it!
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_2_Any_Default	Text	Lena and Dek are already here?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_3_Annie_NPC	Text	I received a message. They're safely back in Coparann.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_4_Any_Default	Text	So they told you about Hector.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_5_Annie_NPC	Text	Yes. Another friend lost...
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_6_Any_Default	Text	You mean Arwin Merton?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_7_Annie_NPC	Text	Never mind me. This was the Soraks, I know.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_8_Any_Default	Text	Actually, we found proof that it was.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_9_Annie_NPC	Text	Oh... and you saved two of my kids, I shall never forget.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_10_Any_Default	Text	We must go, Annie. See you!
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_1_Any_Default	Text	Are you the local… boss of the Scavengers?
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_2_Milan_NPC	Text	You could say that.
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_3_Milan_NPC	Text	Not boss of much, I'm afraid.
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_4_Milan_NPC	Text	We used to have adventurers raiding around here, but now there's just one.
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_5_Any_Default	Text	One?
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_6_Milan_NPC	Text	She's around somewhere. You might run into her.
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_7_Any_Default	Text	We did find an interesting place, though - an old Tirmarian monastery.
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_8_Milan_NPC	Text	Oh, really?
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_9_Milan_NPC	Text	Tell me where. We'll take care of it.
Narration/&PriestessOfPakri1_Priestess_NPC	Text	The law provides, adventurers!
Narration/&PriestessOfPakri2_Pakri_Default	Text	Pakri preserve us!
Narration/&PriestessOfPakri4_Priestess_NPC	Text	May the owl watch over you, faithful one.
Narration/&PriestessOfPakri3_Priestess_NPC	Text	May you find the answers you seek, adventurers.
Narration/&PriestOfMaraike1_Priest_NPC	Text	There's life yet, adventurers!
Narration/&PriestOfMaraike2_Maraike_Default	Text	Maraike smile on you!
Narration/&PriestOfMaraike3_Priest_NPC	Text	Lady of life! A follower of the goddess.
Narration/&PriestOfMaraike4_Priest_NPC	Text	Walk in life, adventurers.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_1_MayorBrightspark_NPC	Text	Ah - deputies!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_2_Philosopher_Default	Text	Clear skies, lady mayor!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_3_MayorBrightspark_NPC	Text	Hem. Well, a renowned mind of Caer Cyflen has asked to see you.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_4_MayorBrightspark_NPC	Text	I believe you know him - Galeafin Pureheart?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_5_Philosopher_Default	Text	Indeed! A very fine mind and a beloved teacher!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_6_MayorBrightspark_NPC	Text	Well, he's heard about your exploits and would like to talk to you.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_7_Philosopher_Default	Text	Gladly! It will be good to see my old teacher! Clear skies!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_8_MayorBrightspark_NPC	Text	Clear skies! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_1_Philosopher_Default	Text	Clear skies! We would like to meet Master Pureheart!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_2_Butler_NPC	Text	You don't have an appointment? Who shall I announce?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_3_Philosopher_Default	Text	A companion of the third enlightenment!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_4_GaleafinPureheart_NPC	Text	Clear skies, my student! To what do I owe the pleasure? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_5_Philosopher_Default	Text	Mayor Bright-Spark asked us to visit you.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_6_GaleafinPureheart_NPC	Text	Ah yes, this matter for the Council! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_7_Philosopher_Default	Text	What matter? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_8_GaleafinPureheart_NPC	Text	The matter of evil, and what motivates people to choose evil.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_9_Philosopher_Default	Text	A weighty matter indeed!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_10_GaleafinPureheart_NPC	Text	Yes, and I need your help! Tell me about your missions!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_11_GaleafinPureheart_NPC	Text	I am cleared to hear everything! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_12_Philosopher_Default	Text	Well… it all began at Caer Lem…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_13_GaleafinPureheart_NPC	Text	Many thanks! You gave me much to ponder. We shall meet again soon!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_14_Philosopher_Normal	Text	Clear skies, master!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_15_GaleafinPureheart_NPC	Text	Clear skies to you!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_1_Philosopher_Normal	Text	Clear skies, Master Pureheart. You sent for us? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_2_Galeafin_NPC	Text	Yes, indeed! I would like more…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_3_Galeafin_NPC	Text	…details about your dealings with the Sorr-Akkath.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_4_Philosopher_Normal	Text	Certainly. How goes your research?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_5_Galeafin_NPC	Text	You gave me much to consider. But I need more…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_6_Galeafin_NPC	Text	…hence this invitation
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_7_Galeafin_NPC	Text	There is much talk about Sorr-Akkath cruelty…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_8_Galeafin_NPC	Text	Did you witness it first hand?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_9_Philosopher_Normal	Text	Alas, quite often! When they fight…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_10_Philosopher_Normal	Text	They enjoy inflicting pain before killing!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_11_Galeafin_NPC	Text	But why, why so much suffering? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_12_Philosopher_Normal	Text	We think it is the will of their god, Sorr-Tarr.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_13_Galeafin_NPC	Text	He expects them to spread terror…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_14_Philosopher_Normal	Text	…so he can influence and…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_15_Philosopher_Normal	Text	…pervert humans… control them.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_16_Galeafin_NPC	Text	Humans, you say? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_17_Philosopher_Normal	Text	Yes - others seem less susceptible…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_18_Philosopher_Normal	Text	… from what we understand of them!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_19_Galeafin_NPC	Text	And so he relies on cruelty to… to do what? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_20_Philosopher_Normal	Text	To gain a hold! Those he can't control, he blackmails or breaks their will!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_21_Galeafin_NPC	Text	Fascinating…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_22_Philosopher_Normal	Text	Does it help?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_23_Galeafin_NPC	Text	Oh, yes, very much.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_24_Galeafin_NPC	Text	Thank you very much.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_25_Philosopher_Normal	Text	Until next time, then, Master!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_1_Philosopher_Default	Text	Clear skies, Master!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_2_Galeafin_NPC	Text	Clear skies!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_3_Galeafin_NPC	Text	We live in fascinating times!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_4_Philosopher_Default	Text	Too true!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_5_Galeafin_NPC	Text	So, about our last meeting… 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_6_Philsopher_Insight_Success_Automatic_Default	Text	Still troubled, Master?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_7_Galeafin_NPC	Text	Yes, indeed.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_8_Galeafin_NPC	Text	I have had occasion to witness… certain things.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_9_Philosopher_Default	Text	What things?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_10_Galeafin_NPC	Text	I am not entirely sure. Violent rituals…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_11_Galeafin_NPC	Text	…they reminded me of what you said.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_12_Galeafin_NPC	Text	About cruelty and Sorr-Tarr's ways.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_13_Philosopher_Default	Text	Master! You're scaring me, now!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_14_Galeafin_NPC	Text	I need to think! Can you come back tomorrow?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_15_Philosopher_Default	Text	Of course!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_16_Any_Default	Text	You realize something very bad might be happening to him?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_17_Philosopher_Default	Text	I know. Let's just… come back tomorrow.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_1_Philosopher_Default	Text	Clear skies! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_2_Galeafin_NPC	Text	Ah, my friend. Let me introduce Lady Illoreth, my paramour! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_3_Philosopher_Default	Text	Master?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_4_Illoreth_NPC	Text	Clear skies, senior deputies!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_5_Philosopher_Default	Text	Why do you call us that? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_6_Illoreth_NPC	Text	Because you are the reason I was sent after Galeafin, the most gentle soul on Solasta.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_7_InsightSuccessDC15_Default	Text	I knew there was some treachery afoot here!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_8_InsightFailDC15_Default	Text	What?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_9_Philosopher_Default	Text	You'd better explain yourself quickly!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_10_Illoreth_NPC	Text	I am an infiltrator from the Coven of Arivad!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_11_Selfpres_Default	Text	They're here in Caer Cyflen?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_12_Illoreth_NPC	Text	I was to seduce Galeafin to make him work for us!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_13_Illoreth_NPC	Text	But instead, he changed me!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_14_Illoreth_NPC	Text	He showed me that even a corrupted soul like mine still had some good. 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_15_Illoreth_NPC	Text	And I won't let any harm come to him!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_16_Philosopher_Default	Text	How can we believe you?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_17_Illoreth_NPC	Text	I am not the danger! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_18_Illoreth_NPC	Text	The Coven will soon ask me to bring him in to turn him!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_19_Philosopher_Default	Text	And?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_20_Illoreth_NPC	Text	I can take you there - right to a splinter cell of the Coven!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_21_InsightSuccessDC15_Default	Text	What do you want? 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_22_Illoreth_NPC	Text	Just to be free - to make a new life somewhere else.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_23_Illoreth_NPC	Text	We are too well known to stay here, but we want to stay together!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_24_Illoreth_NPC	Text	The Coven knew of your mission and sent me to get information from you…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_25_Illoreth_NPC	Text	I am not sure I am the only agent who knows…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_26_Illoreth_NPC	Text	…and Galeafin must disappear to be safe.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_27_Philosopher_Default	Text	Do you truly want to leave, Master?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_28_Galeafin_NPC	Text	Yes. Where Illoreth goes, I shall follow! 
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_29_Philosopher_Default	Text	Very well, we shall come when you send for us!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_1_Philosopher_Default	Text	Is it time?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_3_Philosopher_Default	Text	And once inside?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_4_Illoreth_NPC	Text	Wait for my signal!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_5_Illoreth_NPC	Text	And until then, let me speak.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_1_Guard_NPC	Text	State your business!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_2_Illoreth_NPC	Text	Glory of souls!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_3_Guard_NPC	Text	Power to the One!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_4_Illoreth_NPC	Text	We're running late! Are we the last?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_5_Guard_NPC	Text	Yes! All are awaiting your guest.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_7_Illoreth_NPC	Text	New recruits.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_8_Guard_NPC	Text	It's one at a time, you know the rules!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_9_Illoreth_NPC	Text	Indeed, I know them.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_10_Illoreth_BANTER	Text	Follow me to the basement.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_11_Sarcastic_BANTER	Text	Let me guess - that was the signal!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_1_Any_Default	Text	Look at this! Marshal Sunblaze will be delighted!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_2_Cynical_Default	Text	Or scared to death!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_3_Selfpres_Default	Text	Where's Illoreth?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_4_Any_Default	Text	I suppose she grabbed her reward… she ran.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_5_Philosopher_Default	Text	Farewell, Master.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_6_Philosopher_Default	Text	May your wisdom serve you well, now.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_01_Default	Text	What's this? A shrine?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_02_Default	Text	Someone here worshipped Arun, a long time ago.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_03_Default	Text	That someone ruined their own shrine?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_04_Default	Text	Maybe it was just the cataclysm.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_05_Default	Text	There's a small chest, here.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_1_Acolyte_Default	Text	Clear skies, Chaplain Lark! You wanted to see me? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_2_DalonLark_NPC	Text	Clear skies! Yes, thanks for coming so quickly!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_3_DalonLark_NPC	Text	Remember that monastery near Coparann?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_4_Acolyte_Default	Text	The Tirmarian ruins? Of course.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_5_DalonLark_NPC	Text	There was a cemetery there.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_6_Acolyte_Default	Text	Chaplain Ardentfire, Priest of Arun, would like to talk to you about it.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_7_DalonLark_NPC	Text	I shall go to him right away! Clear skies! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_8_Acolyte_Default	Text	Even if I don't pray to Arun, I'm happy to be of service.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_9_DalonLark_NPC	Text	Clear skies! Einar guards you all! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_1_Rogar_NPC	Text	Ah, there you are!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_2_Acolyte_Default	Text	Chaplain Dalon Lark told us you'd like to talk?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_3_Rogar_NPC	Text	Many thanks for coming! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_4_Rogar_NPC	Text	It's about the Sunblaze Monastery.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_5_Acolyte_Default	Text	We're all ears!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_6_Rogar_NPC	Text	The Scavengers said that many tombs in the cemetery bore the name of the Darwaz family.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_7_Acolyte_Default	Text	And?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_8_Rogar_NPC	Text	Emtan Darwaz ruled this monastery…
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_9_Rogar_NPC	Text	He was a renowned prelate on Tirmar.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_10_Rogar_NPC	Text	The heads of the Church searched for him for years.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_11_Rogar_NPC	Text	Then he was thought to be lost, either left on the home world…
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_12_Rogar_NPC	Text	…or killed in the Cataclysm.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_13_Rogar_NPC	Text	Now, we know he was alive - he buried his brothers and family in the Badlands!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_14_Acolyte_Default	Text	A sad tale, for sure.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_15_Rogar_NPC	Text	Worse. As this cursed symbol suggests.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_16_Rogar_NPC	Text	I prayed for his soul, and Arun sent me a sign.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_17_Acolyte_Default	Text	A sign?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_18_Rogar_NPC	Text	Chaplain Darwaz' soul never joined Arun. It is trapped.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_19_Rogar_NPC	Text	He might have cursed his own symbol.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_20_Rogar_NPC	Text	The souls of his brothers also wander, somewhere in this land.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_21_Rogar_NPC	Text	Someone must go and cleanse their remains with holy water.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_22_Acolyte_Default	Text	Will that suffice?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_23_Rogar_NPC	Text	Not if Emtan is indeed cursed - his soul will be too angry.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_24_Rogar_NPC	Text	Then you'll need to reason with him. I imbued his symbol with Arun's magic - use it as proof.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_25_Acolyte_Default	Text	And if he doesn't listen to reason? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_26_Rogar_NPC	Text	Then - and only then - you will have to destroy him. 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_27_Acolyte_Default	Text	We will do what is necessary.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_28_Rogar_NPC	Text	May Arun's fire warm your heart! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_29_Acolyte_Default	Text	Clear skies!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_1_Sarcastic_Default	Text	Did we forget to close the door on our last visit? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_2_HighestIntOrAny_Default	Text	Never opened it!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_3_Sarcastic_Default	Text	Well, someone's dropped by!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_5_Acolyte_Default	Text	Let's cleanse those tombs with holy water!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_6_Sarcastic_Default	Text	Not many remains left for the prayer!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_7_Acolyte_Default	Text	You had to say it! Get ready, people!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_8_Sarcastic_Default	Text	We're not going to try talking to them first? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_9a_AcolyteIfReligionDC10Success_Default	Text	Zombies don't talk!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_9b_AcolyteIfReligionDC10Failure_Default	Text	No harm in trying, I guess.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_11_Acolyte_Default	Text	May the light of the gods free your souls!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_12_Sarcastic_Default	Text	Sheesh! Don't pray for me if I die! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_1_Emtan_NPC	Text	Who are you to disturb our eternal rest?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_2_Acolyte_Default	Text	A follower of the gods, hoping to save your soul!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_3_Emtan_NPC	Text	There are no gods in this place, fool! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_4_Acolyte_Default	Text	Do you truly believe that? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_5_Emtan_NPC	Text	Of course! Otherwise, they would have answered us in our hour of need! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_5_Acolyte_Default	Text	Did they not? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_5b_Emtan_NPC	Text	I prayed and no answer came!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_6a_Acolyte_Default	Text	Yes, it did!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_7a_Emtan_NPC	Text	Liar!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_8a_Acolyte_Default	Text	Did you not have water and the means to grow food?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_9a_Emtan_NPC	Text	Barely!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_8b_Acolyte_Default	Text	Were monsters not kept at bay from your valley?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_9b_Emtan_NPC	Text	We heard them roaming around at night! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_8c_Acolyte_Default	Text	Weren't you spared the worst of the mana collapse?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_9c_Emtan_NPC	Text	What?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_10_Acolyte_Default	Text	And yet you survived how many years here? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_11_Emtan_NPC	Text	But my prayers weren't answered!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_12_Acolyte_Default	Text	Yes, they were! You were just too mad with grief to see it!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_6b_Acolyte_Default	Text	Behold, the power of Arun, apostate!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_7b_Emtan_NPC	Text	It won't work, you fool!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_13_Emtan_NPC	Text	Arun! The lord is still here!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_14_Acolyte_Default	Text	It is time for you to enjoy your final rest, Emtan Darwaz, Acolyte of Arun!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_15_Emtan_NPC	Text	Thank you…
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_1_Acolyt_Normal	Text	Clear skies, Chaplain Ardentfire!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_1_Rogar_NPC	Text	Clear skies! Did you bring peace to those troubled souls? 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_2_Acolyte_Default	Text	Yes, all of them are with the gods now! 
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_3_Rogar_NPC	Text	And Emtan?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_4_Acolyt_Normal	Text	Saved. He is with Arun.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_5_Rogar_NPC	Text	Many thanks, I will call his name during prayers!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_6_Rogar_NPC	Text	Tragedy. The curse of Sorr-Tarr hurts us, still.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_7_Failed	Text	We couldn't bring him back. He's gone.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest1_Belmont_NPC	Text	You? I know you!
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest2_Spy_Default	Text	What?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest3_Belmont_NPC	Text	You were at the embassy! An aide or something… 
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest4_Spy_Default	Text	You're mistaken. I'm a Council deputy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest5_Belmont_NPC	Text	You can't fool me, I never forget a face.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest6_Anyother_Default	Text	What's going on, friend?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest7_Spy_Default	Text	Never mind.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest8_Belmont_NPC	Text	That same week, the Gallivan envoy somehow got hold of our plans for the trade treaty… 
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest9_Spy_Default	Text	Stop bothering us - we're guests of the princess.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest10_Noble_Default	Text	He's a Belmont. Be careful - they're a powerful family in the Snow Alliance.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest11_Belmont_NPC	Text	This isn't over. Now I found you, we'll settle this!
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest12_Anyother_Default	Text	Anything we should know?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest13_Spy_Default	Text	Old story.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest14_Anyother_Default	Text	Look, if this is going to be a problem, we need to fix it - together.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest15_Anyother_Default	Text	I agree.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest16_Spy_Default	Text	All right, then I'll need to see someone at the Gallivan embassy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest17_Guard_NPC	Text	Who goes there?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest18_Spy_Default	Text	I'd like to see ambassador Crawley.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest19_Guard_NPC	Text	Council business?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest20_Spy_Default	Text	Inaudible
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest21_Guard_NPC	Text	Follow me.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest22_Anyother_Default	Text	Just like that?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest23_Spy_Default	Text	Shut up and follow.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest24_Joran_NPC	Text	I'll be damned. Senior deputy of the Legacy Council.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest25_Spy_Default	Text	Nice to see you, too.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest26_Joran_NPC	Text	Can't say I expected your visit.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest27_Spy_Default	Text	I bumped into Belmont at the Palace residence.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest28_Joran_NPC	Text	And?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest29_Spy_Default	Text	He seems to suspect me over the stolen treaty plans.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest30_Joran_NPC	Text	Seems to?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest31_Spy_Default	Text	He's pretty eager to pin it on me.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest32_Joran_NPC	Text	We can't let that happen.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest33_Spy_Default	Text	That's why I'm here.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest34_Joran_NPC	Text	Them?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest35_Spy_Default	Text	Friends. Trustworthy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest36_Joran_NPC	Text	You have to take him out.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest37_Joran_NPC	Text	I can suggest a course of action.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest38_Joran_NPC	Text	You just need to plant something in the New Empire's embassy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest39_Spy_Default	Text	Oh, is that all?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest40_Joran_NPC	Text	Unless you have friends in the Silent Whisper.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest41_Spy_Default	Text	I might.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest42_Joran_NPC	Text	Once it's in the right hands, this will kill our friend Belmont's credibility.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest43_Spy_Default	Text	It looks like you have this all figured out.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest44_Joran_NPC	Text	I always plan for every contingency.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest45_Joran_NPC	Text	We should go.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest46_Joran_NPC	Text	Then this time it's farewell for good.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest47_Selfpres_Default	Text	You really want to break into the New Empire's embassy?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest48_Pragmatic_Default	Text	This is crazy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest49_Spy_DaliatLives	Text	We can ask Daliat. I think he'll help us.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest50_Starter_Normal	Text	That's not an embassy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest51_Spy_Normal	Text	Just not its best side.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest52_Noble_Slang	Text	Sewers? Really? How did you know about this?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest53_Spy_Slang	Text	Mind your own business. This way. Stay low.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest54_Spy_Formal	Text	Remember, if we're discovered, we're as good as dead.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest55_Spy_Formal	Text	This is it.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest56_Spy_Normal	Text	Let's hope this works.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest57_Spy_Slang	Text	Let's get out of here.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest58_Daliat_NPC	Text	Greetings, colleague.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest59_Spy_Default	Text	I'm not your colleague, Daliat. You know that.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest60_Daliat_NPC	Text	Sure. What can I do for you?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest61_Spy_Default	Text	You know Lord Belmont?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest62_Daliat_NPC	Text	Ambassador Belmont? Of course.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest63_Spy_Default	Text	We have something on Belmont that you might like. Not flattering.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest64_Daliat_NPC	Text	Nice. What's the catch?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest65_Spy_Default	Text	I need you to release it right away.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest66_Daliat_NPC	Text	Right now? No long-term leverage?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest67_Spy_Default	Text	That's right.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest68_Daliat_NPC	Text	I'll need you to do something for me, then.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest69_Spy_Default	Text	I'm listening.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest70_Daliat_NPC	Text	Some… former colleagues are running an operation from a base nearby.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest71_Daliat_NPC	Text	I need them dead.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest72_Spy_Default	Text	We're not murderers.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest73_Daliat_NPC	Text	They're traitors to the Silent Whisper. Ruthless bastards, too.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest74_Spy_Default	Text	Enough to die, just like that?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest75_Daliat_Default	Text	Your choice. Do this for me and I'll take care of the Belmont thing.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest76_Spy_Default	Text	Fair enough.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest77_Spy_Default	Text	Hey! Any news?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest78_Daliat_NPC	Text	It's done. Your… friends won't be a problem anymore.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest79_Spy_Default	Text	Good! I knew I could depend on you.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest80_Daliat_NPC	Text	That tip on Belmont is so good. He's as good as dead.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest81_Daliat_NPC	Text	Pleasure working with you, my friends.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest82_Spy_Default	Text	See you, Daliat.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest83_Spy_Default	Text	Is Lord Belmont around?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest84_Butler_NPC	Text	He had to… return home.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest85_Spy_Default	Text	In a rush?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest86_Butler_NPC	Text	Indeed.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest87_Spy_Default	Text	Thank you, Ravensworth.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest88_Butler_NPC	Text	You're welcome, deputies.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_1_Bagmordah_NPC	Text	Clear skies, friends! I have a letter for someone who fought at Sandreed.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_2_Sellsword_Normal	Text	That'd be me. Who wrote me?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_3_Bagmordah_NPC	Text	Mildred Warmhearth, innkeeper at Coparann's Strike True tavern. Know her?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_4_Sellsword_Normal	Text	Sure do. Well, friends, who's in for a trip back there?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_5_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	Clear skies to you, adventurers! You got my letter?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_6_Sellsword_Normal	Text	Clear skies! What's it all about?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_7_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	Well, I knew your parents - and I know about the events that led to their deaths!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_8_ChoiceA_WRITTEN	Text	You knew my parents? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_9_ChoiceB_WRITTEN	Text	What events?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_10_ChoiceC_WRITTEN	Text	Their deaths?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_11_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	You knew my parents? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_12_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	Sure did. They had a house in the Vale, you know. 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_13_Sellsword_Normal	Text	A house?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_14_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	I wasn't sure the first time I saw you… now I am.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_15_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	Your parents were merchants, and you sometimes traveled with them.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_16_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	They worked a circuit from the Principality to the Marches.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_17_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	They were shrewd and successful. 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_18_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	So the house belongs to you now, I guess! 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_19_ChoiceB_Normal	Text	What events? What are you talking about?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_20_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	Fifteen years ago, Coparann was threatened by an orcish horde.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_21_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	They hit us hard, and almost overran the defenses!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_22_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	If the Stonefist company hadn't shown up when they did…
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_23_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	They broke the siege, but we'd already lost a lot of people.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_24_ChoiceC_Normal	Text	How did they die?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_25_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	Text	They died right after the siege. 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_26_Sellsword_Sellsword	Text	After? Not during? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_27_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	Text	No… I… How can I put this?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_28_Sellsword_InsigtDC20Success	Text	They were… responsible. 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_29_Sellsword_InsigtDC20Fail	Text	Come on - spit it out!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_30_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	Text	Well, your parents had been spying for the orcs!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_31_Sellsword_Sellsword	Text	What? No! How? Who said? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_32_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	Text	That's the hardest part.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_33_Sellsword_Sellsword	Text	What do you mean?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_34_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	Text	It was you. Your testimony sealed their fate.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_35_Sellsword_Sellsword	Text	What? Me? How?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_36_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	Text	A seemingly innocent remark, but it led the Ceannard's spymaster to suspect your parents.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_37_Sellsword_Sellsword	Text	How is it possible that I don't remember any of it?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_38_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	Text	The Ceannard took pity on you and made you drink an elixir of forgetfulness.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_39_Sellsword_Sellsword	Text	Very potent, clearly. I don't remember shit from my childhood.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_40_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	Text	Yes. The Ceannard miscalculated the dose.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_41_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	Text	The Baron sent you away, and provided for your education.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_42_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	Text	He was a former mercenary, and he sent you to learn the same trade. 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_43_Sellsword_Sellsword	Text	I guess I should thank him for bleeding in Sandreed… so, there's a house?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_44_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	Text	All yours! No one knew where to find you until now. It's been kept in good order, waiting.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_45_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	Text	Your parents gave me this before they went to meet their fate.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_46_Sellsword_Sellsword	Text	What does that mean, "resist temptation"? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_47_Any_Insight_25_Success_Any_Insight_25_Success	Text	Bribery or Sorak evil perhaps?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_48_Any_Insight_25_Failure_Any_Insight_25_Failure	Text	Bribery?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_49_Sellsword_Sellsword	Text	It was orcs! Let's go search the house for clues!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_50_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth	Text	You should tell Sergeant Nikannen who you are, by the way. I told him you'd come.

Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_2_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	You, too! What can I do for you today, my friend? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_3_Sellsword_Normal	Text	I need the keys to my house in the Vale. Mildred told me.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_4_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	Oh, it's you? You've grown - well, of course you have! Here - take this note to the Archivist!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_5_Sellsword_Normal	Text	Thanks, Sarge!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_1_Sellsword_Slang	Text	Clear skies, Master Archivist!

Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_6_Sellsword_Normal	Text	Thanks! Clear skies!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_1_Any_BUT_sellsword_Normal	Text	Nice house!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_2_Sellsword_Normal	Text	Strange. It feels familiar and unfamiliar at the same time.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_3_Any_BUT_sellsword_Normal	Text	Let's go inside!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_4_Sellsword_Normal	Text	I got something.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_5_Sellsword_Normal	Text	Some stuff, and a note…
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_FightEnd__1_Any_Default	Text	Soraks!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_FightEnd__2_Any_Default	Text	So they're involved, for sure!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_FightEnd__3_Sellsword_Default	Text	I'll find the rest and kill them!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_1_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	Clear skies! Did you go to the house?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_2_Sellsword_Normal	Text	Yes - and I found this note!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_3_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	Interesting - and surprising!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_4_Sellsword_Normal	Text	Surprising? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_5_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	Well, why hide it? They could have shown it to the Ceannard!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_6_Sellsword_Normal	Text	Anyway, this was written by the real spy.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_7_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	So what?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_8_CynicOrElse_Slang	Text	Good luck finding the writer!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_9_Sellsword_Normal	Text	Yes, that's it! 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_10_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	What do you mean? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_11_Sellsword_Normal	Text	The note - the writing reveals the spy.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_12_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	Then why didn't your parents use it at the trial? It would have saved their lives!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_13_Sellsword_Normal	Text	Because they wanted to keep me safe!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_14_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	Then they must have known that the spy was present at their trial!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_15_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	You know… paperwork.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_16_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	The Ceannard, he swears by the rule of law! 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_17_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	Every trial is recorded. It's all in the archives!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_18_Sellsword_Normal	Text	So we have our list of suspects!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_19_MildredWarmhearth_NPC	Text	Exactly!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_1_AllanMiller_NPC	Text	Clear skies! What can I do for you today? 
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_2_Sellsword_Normal	Text	We need to consult the archives!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_3_AllanMiller_NPC	Text	Give me the year and the case, and I'll get whatever you need!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_4_AcademicOrElse_Normal	Text	Is that your writing? I've never seen anything so neat!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_5_AllanMiller_NPC	Text	It's my job. An archive needs to be clear and legible!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_6_Sellsword_Slang	Text	Right - so your agents don't misunderstand your orders. Traitor!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_7_AllanMiller_NPC	Text	Ah, you're too smart for you own good.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_1_Ceannard_NPC	Text	Ah - I was expecting you.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_2_Sellsword_Default	Text	Ceannard. 
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_3_Ceannard_NPC	Text	You know the truth. I hope you can forgive me.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_4_Ceannard_NPC	Text	To think the Soraks were already here…
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_5_Ceannard_NPC	Text	…manipulating me…
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_6_Sellsword_Default	Text	It's in the past.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_7_Sellsword_Default	Text	Though I'd like you to restore my family's name.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_8_Ceannard_NPC	Text	The paperwork is under way.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_9_Ceannard_NPC	Text	Their names will be on a memorial I intend to build.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_10_Sellsword_Default	Text	Thank you.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_11_Ceannard_NPC	Text	Clear skies, my friends.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start1_Bagmordah_NPC	Text	Ah, there you are! Clear skies, my friends!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start2_Bagmordah_NPC	Text	Someone came to see you.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start3_Academic_Default	Text	Me? Who?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start4_Bagmordah_NPC	Text	An old acquaintance, I gather. Master Dackin.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start5_Bagmordah_NPC	Text	He said he'd wait for you at Sunblaze Court.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start6_Academic_Default	Text	Oh! Thanks for the message. Stay in the light!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start7_Anyother_Default	Text	Everything all right?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start8_Academic_Default	Text	Like she said - an old acquaintance.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster1_Dackin_NPC	Text	You came! I wondered, considering your new… rank.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster2_Academic_Default	Text	How are you, Master?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster3_Dackin_NPC	Text	It's nice that you pretend to care…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster4_Academic_Default	Text	Are you going to hate me forever?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster5_Dackin_NPC	Text	I don't hate you. I just…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster6_Dackin_NPC	Text	…well, it was your right to leave and…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster7_Dackin_NPC	Text	…pursue a life of adventure.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster8_Dackin_NPC	Text	Even if it wastes your academic talent.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster9_Academic_Default	Text	It serves me well, thanks to you.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster10_Dackin_NPC	Text	Maybe. Still, I'm without an assistant. 
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster11_Dackin_NPC	Text	Times have been hard.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster12_Dackin_NPC	Text	The Guild offered me a posting… south.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster13_Academic_Default	Text	You're not getting your department chair?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster14_Dackin_NPC	Text	Evidently not - unless I can make a major contribution.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster15_Dackin_NPC	Text	That's why I wanted to see you.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster16_Dackin_NPC	Text	I heard you went to Caer Lem, in the Marches.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster17_Academic_Default	Text	That's right.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster18_Dackin_NPC	Text	There is an old Tirmarian tower there.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster19_Academic_Default	Text	Oh, yes. Very impressive, too.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster20_Dackin_NPC	Text	If I could just explore it - bring something back…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster21_Dackin_NPC	Text	Something the Guild couldn't ignore…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster22_Dackin_NPC	Text	I would have a chance at this chair.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster23_Dackin_NPC	Text	The Scavengers say it's safe now. I can go.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster24_Dackin_NPC	Text	But once there, I'll need… well, some specific expertise.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster25_Academic_Default	Text	…and that's us.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster26_Dackin_NPC	Text	It could salvage my career!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster27_Academic_Default	Text	Of course. I owe you that much, Master.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster28_Dackin_NPC	Text	Thanks. Find me at Caer Lem, then. I'll be ready!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster29_Academic_Default	Text	We'll see you there. Stay in the light, Master!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem1_Friendly_Default	Text	Clear skies, friend!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem2_Bertram_NPC	Text	Clear skies, deputy!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem3_Greed_WRITTEN	Text	How's business in Caer Lem?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem4_Friendly_WRITTEN	Text	What's your name?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem5_Nosy_WRITTEN	Text	Did you find the secret passage?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem6_Pragmatic_WRITTEN	Text	Have you seen Master Dackin?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem7_Greed_Choice	Text	How's business been since we… cleaned up the place?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem8_Bertram_NPC	Text	Not bad! Some folks are starting to explore a little further.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem9_Bertram_NPC	Text	Though this… Sorak attack still has people nervous.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem10_Bertram_NPC	Text	Still, there's been no sign of them since…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem11_Bertram_NPC	Text	…so we mostly pretend it didn't happen.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem12_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Huh - good for you.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem13_Bertram_NPC	Text	I'm Bertram.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem14_Friendly_Default	Text	Good to meet you, Bertram.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem15_Bertram_NPC	Text	I think so, but… your Sorak buddies seem to have blocked it.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem16_Bertram_NPC	Text	They must have dug a little too hard in there.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem17_Greed_Default	Text	I'm sure we can solve this little problem.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem18_Bertram_NPC	Text	The Antiquarian? Sure.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem19_Bertram_NPC	Text	He's in the courtyard.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem20_Bertram_NPC	Text	He's been staring at the tower…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem21_Bertram_NPC	Text	…trying to figure a way to get up there.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem22_Bertram_NPC	Text	But he can't fly… wait, can he?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem23_Academic_Default	Text	Seems not.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster1_Dackin_NPC	Text	There you are!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster2_Academic_Default	Text	Are you ready for this?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster3_Dackin_NPC	Text	I am. Any idea how to get up there?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster4_Academic_Default	Text	One or two.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster5_Dackin_NPC	Text	I tried to think of a way, but…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster6_Dackin_NPC	Text	…still, this place is incredible!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster7_Dackin_NPC	Text	Did you notice that there was minor gate just here in the courtyard?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster8_Academic_Default	Text	As a matter of fact, I did.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster9_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Let's get to it, if you don't mind.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower1_Dackin_NPC	Text	Fantastic… it looks like… well, another world.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower2_Dackin_NPC	Text	You must have seen so much!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower3_Academic_Default	Text	I have. But this is still…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower4_Dackin_NPC	Text	…fascinating.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower5_Anyother_Default	Text	Well, I see where you got your passion for learning!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower6_Academic_Default	Text	Let's look around.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower7_Academic_Default	Text	Gather all the antiques we can.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary1_Dackin_NPC	Text	By all the gods!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary2_Dackin_NPC	Text	This is really something. 
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary3_Academic_Default	Text	It explains the library we found down in the caves.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary4_Dackin_NPC	Text	The place seems… dangerous.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary5_Academic_Default	Text	Definitely. Be ready for a fight.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary6_Dackin_NPC	Text	Wait - you know me. I don't fight.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight1_Academic_Default	Text	Are you all right, Master?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight2_Dackin_NPC	Text	I am… alive, or so it seems.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight3_Academic_Default	Text	Those are quite common in the Marches.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight4_Dackin_NPC	Text	Just tell me there's something valuable down here!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight5_Academic_Default	Text	Oh, I think you'll be happy.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending1_Dackin_NPC	Text	This is… more than I dared hope for… so much more!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending2_Academic_Default	Text	Good! I think the Guild will treat you a little better now. They'd lick your boots for a look at these!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending3_Dackin_NPC	Text	I'd like to see them do that - one or two of them, in particular…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending4_Dackin_NPC	Text	These will be perfect! Take whatever else you want - I have plenty!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending5_Dackin_NPC	Text	…And thank you. 
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending6_Academic_Default	Text	You're welcome, Master.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending7_Dackin_NPC	Text	I think it's time you stop calling me that, you know.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending8_Academic_Default	Text	Well, how about Chairman of the Guild, then? With these books…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending9_Dackin_NPC	Text	Stay in the light, my friend!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending10_Academic_Default	Text	You, too!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start1_Merton_NPC	Text	Hey! Interested in a little side-job?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start2_Player_Default	Text	What kind of side-job?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start3_Merton_NPC	Text	The kind that takes particular skills and contacts.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start4_Merton_NPC	Text	In the - shall we say - involuntary gift business.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start5_Player_Default	Text	Involuntary gift business'? That's just embarrassing.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start6_Player_Default	Text	Say what you mean - the underworld, right?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start7_Merton_NPC	Text	And there I was trying to be discreet.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start8_Lowlife_Default	Text	Try harder. Suppose I do have the skills and contacts you're looking for?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start9_Merton_NPC	Text	Go to Annie Bagmordah at the Scavengers.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start10_Merton_NPC	Text	Tell her I sent you.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie1_Lowlifeb_Default	Text	Merton says you got a problem.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie2_Annie_NPC	Text	Uh… Arwin…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie3_Annie_NPC	Text	What makes you think you can help?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie4_Lowlifeb_Default	Text	Not saying I can, yet. But I know people.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie5_Annie_NPC	Text	People who can track down stolen goods?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie6_Lowlifeb_Default	Text	What kind of goods?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie6_Annie_NPC	Text	A sword. Imperial.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie7_Annie_NPC	Text	The guard has three diamonds. Probably magical.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie8_Curious_Default	Text	Probably? What does it probably do?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie9_Annie_NPC	Text	Never got a chance to find out.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie10_Greedy_Default	Text	You offering a reward?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie11_Annie_NPC	Text	I'll make it worth your while.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie12_Joker_Default	Text	Are you not the one supposed to bring back stuff?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie13_Annie_NPC	Text	Very funny.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel1_Lowlife_Default	Text	Hey, Nel! Still laughing?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel2_Nel_NPC	Text	Like Misaye herself! You?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel3_Lowlife_NPC	Text	Happy as a rat in a granary. Need an ear out.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel4_Nel_NPC	Text	For?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel5_Lowlife_Default	Text	A nice antique sword with three diamonds.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel6_Lowlife_Default	Text	Hear anything?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel7_Nel_NPC	Text	Something. Talk to Gorim.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel8_Joker_Default	Text	So that's your former life, walking the streets?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel9_Lowlife_Default	Text	And cutting the throats of people who crossed me.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie1_Lowlife_Default	Text	Hey, Gorim! I'm in the market for a sword.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie2_Lowlife_Default	Text	A very particular one.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie3_Gorim_NPC	Text	How particular?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie4_Lowlife_Default	Text	Imperial, three diamonds in the guard, probably magical.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie5_Lowlife_Default	Text	Sound familiar?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie6_Gorim_NPC	Text	Too expensive for me. I turned him down.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie7_Lowlife_Default	Text	He have a name?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie8_Gorim_NPC	Text	Didn't say. I told him to ask for Surespell at the Gravekeep's Cask.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie9_Gorim_NPC	Text	The Arcaneum has money.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie10_Lowlife_Default	Text	Thanks.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie11_Gorim_NPC	Text	Thank me by buying something.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie12_Lowlife_Default	Text	Another time, but I will.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie13_Gorim_NPC	Text	I'll remember!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern1_Karel_NPC	Text	Hey, Karel!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern2_Lowlife_Default	Text	Back again?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern3_Karel_NPC	Text	Has anyone been in asking for Surespell?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern4_Karel_NPC	Text	The Arcaneum guy?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern5_Karel_NPC	Text	Yes, as it happens. Over there. Still waiting, it seems.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern6_Lowlife_Default	Text	Thanks.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern7_Lowlife_Default	Text	I've been looking for you.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern8_Thief_NPC	Text	I'm waiting for someone, and you're not him. Get lost.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern9_ChoiceA_WRITTEN	Text	You have a stolen sword.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern10_ChoiceB_WRITTEN	Text	Let's make a deal.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern11_ChoiceC_WRITTEN	Text	You're in trouble.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern12_Intimidator_Answer1	Text	Don't come the hard case with me. You won't win.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern13_Intimidator_Answer2	Text	You have a sword that doesn't belong to you.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern14_Thief_Success	Text	Listen, I don't want any trouble… 
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern15_Thief_Failure	Text	You deaf or something? I said, get lost!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern16_Persuader_Answer1	Text	You're waiting for someone to buy a sword.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern17_Persuader_Answer2	Text	Old, three diamonds, probably magical. Am I right?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern18_Thief_Success	Text	How do you…?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern19_Thief_Success2	Text	Doesn't matter.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern20_Thief_Success2	Text	What matters is, do you want a Council deputy owing you a favor?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern21_Thief_Success3	Text	It had better be a pretty big favor.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern22_Thief_Failure	Text	I can make better friends than you with a sword like that…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern23_Thief_Failure	Text	…and get paid too!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern24_Deceiver_Answer1	Text	It's about that very nice sword…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern25_Deceiver_Answer2	Text	…that you're thinking of selling…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern26_Deceiver_Answer3	Text	…to Heddlon Surespell of the Arcaneum.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern28_Deceiver_Success2	Text	What matters is, do you want to end up nailed to a door in Fishtown?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern29_Thief_Success3	Text	What?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern30_Deceiver_Success4	Text	You see, the sword was already spoken for when you stole it from the Scavengers…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern31_Deceiver_Success5	Text	…and a certain someone's going to be very disappointed if they don't get it as planned.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern32_Deceiver_Success6	Text	The sort of someone who nails people to doors in Fishtown.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern33_Thief_NPC	Text	Misaye's crooked dice! I… I can get it for you.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern34_Deceiver_Success7	Text	Just tell me where to find it. Then it might be wise to leave town.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern35_Deceiver_Success8	Text	I hear the Southern Isles are lovely at this time of year.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern36_Thief_Failure1	Text	Ooh! I'm so scared. Sell your drivel somewhere else.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern37_Any_Allfailed	Text	Perhaps you missed our nice badge, here.

Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest9_Stig_NPC	Text	Anyway, I need help.

Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest13_Lawkeeper_Default	Text	Hey, Stig is my friend!

Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge30_Cynical_Default	Text	Now that's a conspiracy!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge31_Cynical_Default	Text	There might be an angry husband.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge32_Cynical_Default	Text	It might be worth an arrest.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge33_Lawkeeper_Default	Text	Shut up!

Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk70_Default_WRITTEN	Text	The question is, what are you doing?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk71_Persuasion_CHOICE	Text	We got you. Let us take some of these and we'll keep quiet.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk72_Drunk_FAIL	Text	You Council people really think you can do whatever you like, don't you?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk73_Intimidation_CHOICE	Text	We caught you red-handed. Just confess.

Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk84_Drunk_NPC	Text	As everyone knows, everything for her personal use is tax free.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk85_Cynical_Default	Text	I knew that.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk86_Drunk_NPC	Text	Ask the Captain. Go right ahead.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk87_Lawkeeper_Default	Text	That won't be necessary. Carry on.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple88_TempleGuard_NPC	Text	Rodric isn't here.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple89_TempleGuard_NPC	Text	Rodric? He's on an errand.

Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End100_Lawkeeper_Default	Text	A secret tunnel? We're on to something here!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End101_Lawkeeper_Default	Text	What have you found?

Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End107_Lawkeeper_Default	Text	Take this. You can follow up and shut down his network.

Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start16_Cynical_Default	Text	Wouldn't put it past you.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start17_Aristocrat_Default	Text	What is the mess, exactly?

Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew13_Aristocrat_Default	Text	Listen, I have no idea…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew14_Drew_NPC	Text	Of course! It's just bad luck that you got everything.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew15_Aristocrat_Default	Text	Can we talk?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew16_Drew_NPC	Text	Talk to my lawyer. Oh, wait…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew17_Violent_Default	Text	He needs a smack in the mouth.

Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria110_Adria_NPC	Text	Lyria is a lying bitch, and Drew is a tactless jerk.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria111_Aristocrat_Default	Text	What would you do with the inheritance?

Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending2_Lyria_NPC	Text	So you left Caer Cyflen without a word.

Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending6_Lyria_NPC	Text	At least share the inheritance. I need it for my research.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending7_Lyria_Default	Text	The Circle of Danantar will reward you.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending8_Drew_NPC	Text	Yeah, right. That inheritance will give me enough to get married…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending9_Drew_Default	Text	My father-in-law to be is very influential in the Tower of Knowledge, you know.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending10_Aristocrat_Default	Text	Adria?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending11_Adria_NPC	Text	I respect Mother's decision. It's all yours.

Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending35_Notary_NPC	Text	Well, that's settled, then.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending36_Notary_NPC	Text	I will magically seal the will.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending37_Notary_NPC	Text	I'm sorry, the law forbids it.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending38_Notary_NPC	Text	You can share it after you accept it, but there must be one single heir.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending39_Notary_NPC	Text	You know… paperwork.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending40_Adria_NPC	Text	Fine… I thought I had cracked you…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending41_Aristocrat_Default	Text	What?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending42_Adria_Default	Text	Sorry, sir, this will have to be done outside the law, I'm afraid.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending43_Anyother_Default	Text	She killed all her siblings?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending44_Cynical_Default	Text	Maybe she was a Sorak agent?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending45_Aristocrat_Default	Text	They were all my childhood friends…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending46_Cynical_Default	Text	Oh, yes. Sorry.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending47_Aristocrat_Default	Text	It's over. Let's go.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_01_Default_Default	Text	Who's this? Seems to like wolves.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_02_Insight_10_Success	Text	Could be a ranger. Could be a werewolf. Could be something else.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_03_Kill-CHOICE	Text	Let's kill them!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_04_Leave_CHOICE	Text	Let's get out of here!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_05_Speak_CHOICE	Text	Let's talk to him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_06_Kill_Default	Text	Just someone else to kill. No one out here is friendly, remember?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_07_Friendly_Default	Text	Maybe he knows something about the castle. It can't hurt to ask.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_08_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Out here, there's no such thing as "can't hurt." 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_09_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Didn't your mother tell you never to talk to strangers?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_10_Leave_Default	Text	We're not here to make friends, and we have enough enemies. Let's just go!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_11_Speak_Default	Text	He might know something about the castle. It can't hurt to ask.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_12_Persuade_CHOICE	Text	Hello!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_13_Intimidate_CHOICE	Text	Get over here!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_14_Friendly_Default	Text	Hello! We come in peace! Can we talk to you?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_15_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Success	Text	Talk, then. And stay where you are. I can hear you well enough from here.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_16_Persuade_Default_20_Success	Text	We're… interested in the castle. Can you tell us anything about it?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_17_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Success	Text	Not much. What do you want to know?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_18_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Failure	Text	You come in peace, do you? Then you're the only peaceful things here.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_19_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Failure	Text	Go in peace, before I get tired of being peaceful.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_20_Intimidate_Default	Text	Hey, you! Get over here!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_21_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Success	Text	I can hear you fine from here. What do you want?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_22_Intimidate_Default_20_Success	Text	What do you know about that castle over there?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_23_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Success	Text	What do you want to know?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_24_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Failure	Text	Ha! Aren't you tough?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_25_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Failure	Text	Believe me, you don't want me coming over there.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_26_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Failure	Text	Now get lost, before I change my mind!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_27_Default_CHOICE	Text	Who lives there?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_28_Fighter_CHOICE	Text	How strong is the garrison?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_29_Authority_CHOICE	Text	Who is its ruler?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_30_Default_Default	Text	Who lives there? What can you tell us about them?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_31_Talbut_NPC	Text	I deal with the guard captain. Name's Adam the Twelfth. Undead now.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_32_Talbut_NPC	Text	He lets us hunt here and we tell him who comes and goes.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_33_Default_Default	Text	Sounds like a good arrangement. So you've never been inside the castle?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_34_Talbut_NPC	Text	No.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_35_Default_Default	Text	And there's no one else outside the castle?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_36_Default_Default	Text	Just a ghost - a dwarf. Doesn't seem dangerous.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_37_Fighter_Default	Text	What's the garrison like? Strong? Weak? Monsters?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_38_Talbut_NPC	Text	The captain's a wraith, or something similar. The guard's mostly skeletons.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_39_Fighter_Default	Text	Mostly?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_40_Talbut_NPC	Text	That's what I've seen from outside. Never been inside.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_41_Authority_Default	Text	Who rules the castle? Or should I rather ask what?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_42_Talbut_NPC	Text	Name's Mardracht. Probably undead, but I never met him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_43_Authority_Default	Text	Probably undead? Why do you say that?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_44_Talbut_NPC	Text	Undead or a necromancer, is my guess. Everyone I've seen there is undead.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_45_WRITTEN_Exit	Text	Thanks, that's all.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_45_Goodbye_Default	Text	Many thanks for the information, uh - I didn't catch your name?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_46_Talbut_NPC	Text	Talbut.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_01_Starter_Normal	Text	Look! What's that?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_02_Partner_Normal	Text	Some kind of incorporeal being - undead, most likely.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_03_Starter_Normal	Text	Look! That must be the dwarf ghost we heard about!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_04_Kill-CHOICE	Text	Let's destroy it!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_05_Leave_CHOICE	Text	Let's keep moving.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_06_Speak_CHOICE	Text	Let's talk to him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_07_Kill_Default	Text	The undead are an affront to nature! They must be destroyed!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_08_Leave_Default	Text	An unnecessary fight is an unnecessary risk. Let's move on.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_09_Speak_Default	Text	I'll take information where I can get it - even from a ghost.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_10_Persuade_CHOICE	Text	We have questions.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_11_Intimidate_CHOICE	Text	Get over here!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_12_Starter_Normal	Text	Hello! Could we ask you some questions?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_13_Starter_Normal	Text	Hello! Are you the Antiquarian we've heard about?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_14_Angbi_NPC	Text	Hello! I am Angbi Kramsson, of the Guild of Antiquarians. Or at least, I used to be.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_15_Intimidate	Text	Hey, you - ghost! Get over here!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_15_Angbi_NPC_Intimidation_25_Success	Text	All right. There's no need to be rude. What do you want?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_16_Angbi_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure	Text	What are you going to do - kill me? Just - leave me alone.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_17_Starter_Default	Text	What can you tell us about the castle? Who lives there?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_18_Angbi_NPC	Text	Two women. A high elf, but living, and quite old. She is a necromancer of some sort.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_19_Starter_Default	Text	And the other?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_20_Angbi_NPC	Text	Once human, but definitely undead now. A Defiler, I think…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_21_Angbi_NPC	Text	…and she had a gang of ghouls with her. Horrid beasts. I avoided them.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_22_Starter_Default	Text	Is there anyone else?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_23_Angbi_NPC	Text	There's a garrison - skeletons, mostly. I avoided them, too.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_01_NPC_Angbi	Text	Actually, I was hoping to ask you a greater favor.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_02_Starter_Default	Text	How can we help you?
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_03_NPC_Angbi	Text	I was killed in this cemetery. My bones are here somewhere.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_04_Partner_Default	Text	And you'd like us to take them home for burial, so you can find peace.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_05_NPC_Angbi	Text	Well, yes - but they got a little scattered. The wolves, you see.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_06_Joker_Normal	Text	Now, that's just rude. 
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_07_NPC_Angbi	Text	As far as I can… feel, they are in three separate places.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_08_Joker_Normal	Text	Well, that's just you all over!
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_09_Helpful_Normal	Text	You can rely on us.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_10_NPC_Angbi	Text	It's not just about burial, although of course I'd be grateful for that, too.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_11_NPC_Angbi	Text	Since I was killed, I've carried on studying this necropolis…
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_12_NPC_Angbi	Text	…but I can't touch material things, including pens - so I haven't been able to update my journal.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_13_Joker_Normal	Text	Now, that's what I call work ethic.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_14_NPC_Angbi	Text	And since my spirit is bound to my mortal remains…
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_15_NPC_Angbi	Text	…I can't return to Caer Cyflen to report in person.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_16_NPC_Angbi	Text	But if you take my bones back, perhaps my spirit could travel with them…
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_17_NPC_Angbi	Text	…and the knowledge I've recovered won't be lost.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_18_Helpful_Formal	Text	We will do as you ask, Angbi Kramsson of the Antiquarians!
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_01_Starter_Default	Text	Delegate Summer! May we speak with you?
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_02_NPC_Halman	Text	Yes - what is it?
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_03_Starter_Default	Text	We have something for you. 
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_04_NPC_Angbi	Text	Or rather, someONE.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_05_NPC_Halman	Text	Angbi? Angbi Kramsson? Is that you?
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_06_NPC_Angbi	Text	It is. Or was. Anyway, I'm here.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_07_NPC_Angbi	Text	These kind deputies brought my bones back, and my spirit came with them.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_08_NPC_Halman	Text	Thank you, deputies. I am in your debt, and so is the Guild of Antiquarians. 
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_09_NPC_Halman	Text	On behalf of the Guild, let me offer you something for your trouble.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_10_NPC_Halman	Text	I will make sure you go home to your family for burial, Angbi.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_11_NPC_Angbi	Text	Thank you, Halman. But before you do, I'd like to make my report.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_12_NPC_Halman	Text	Your report?
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_13_NPC_Angbi	Text	One advantage of being a ghost is the ability to walk through walls, you see…
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_14_NPC_Angbi	Text	…so after my death, I was able to conduct a very thorough survey of an Imperial necropolis.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_15_NPC_Angbi	Text	I couldn't lift a pen to write it down, so I'll report in person. If that's acceptable.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_16_NPC_Halman	Text	Well… I… let me take you to the Chancellor. She will want to know.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_17_NPC_Angbi	Text	Capital! We're distant cousins, you know.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_18_NPC_Halman	Text	No, I didn't.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_01_Caerellian_NPC	Text	You there! Stop! Don't move!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_02_Caerellian_NPC	Text	Who are you?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_03_LEAVE_CHOICE	Text	We should leave.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_04_KILL_CHOICE	Text	We should attack.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_05_PERSUADE_CHOICE	Text	We should negotiate.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_06_DECEIVE_CHOICE	Text	We should trick him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_07_Leave_Default	Text	He's not the listening type, I can tell. We should leave and try another approach.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_08_Kill_Default	Text	It's just a few skeletons. Let's get 'em!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_09_Deceive_Default	Text	Look, I can tell you're a very important and, ah…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_10_Persuade_Default	Text	Will you at least hear us before we go?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_11_Deceiver_Normal	Text	…long-serving officer, so I won't waste your time…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_12_Deceiver_Normal	Text	…the fact is, I'm with the Imperial intelligence service. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_13_Deceiver_Normal	Text	The others don't know, but our mission has been ordered by the Emperor himself.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_14_Deceiver_Normal	Text	Our orders are to meet with your master and ask him certain questions. Nothing more than that.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_15_Caerellian_NPC_Deception_25_Success	Text	It's not up to me. You'll have to deal with the others in the keep.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_16_Caerellian_NPC_Deception_25_Failure	Text	I may be dead, but I'm not stupid.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_16_Caerellian_NPC_Deception_25_Failure2	Text	The Empire fell a thousand years ago. There is no Emperor.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_17_Caerellian_NPC	Text	Take your lies and get out!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_18_Persuader_Normal	Text	We understand that your master values his privacy, and we respect that.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_19_Starter_Normal	Text	You may not have heard of the Legacy Council, but…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_20_Caerellian_NPC	Text	I know the name. That dwarf - Antiquarian, or whatever he calls himself - they sent him too.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_21_Caerellian_NPC	Text	I'll tell you what I told him: your Council has no authority here, and the master does not receive visitors!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_22_Caerellian_NPC	Text	I don't know how you got in, but either you leave peacefully, or…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_23_Persuader_Normal	Text	We know that your master is very learned and powerful. We just want to ask him about something, that's all.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_25_Caerellian_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure	Text	You want to steal from him, more like!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_26_Persuader_Normal	Text	No - I swear…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_01_Lizzaria_NPC	Text	Who are you? What do you want?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_02_INTIMIDATE_CHOICE	Text	Ask for mercy.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_03_KILL_CHOICE	Text	To destroy you.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_04_PERSUADE_CHOICE	Text	To meet your master.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_05_DECEIVE_CHOICE	Text	To make a deal.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_06_Intimidate_Default	Text	Give me one good reason why we shouldn't kill you right here.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_07_Lizzaria_NPC_Intimidation_25_Success	Text	Tell me what you want, and I'll think about it.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_08_Intimidator_Normal	Text	What we want?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_09_Lizzaria_NPC	Text	I know this place. You don't. Let's trade.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_10_Intimidator_Normal	Text	All right - talk.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_11_Lizzaria_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure	Text	Who do you think you're dealing with? 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_17_Lizzaria_NPC	Text	That tough act may impress the girls back home…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_17_Lizzaria_NPC2	Text	…but I've seen scarier things in the mirror.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_18_Kill_Default	Text	You can never trust a necromancer. We should just kill them all.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_19_Persuader_Normal	Text	We need to consult your master about an ancient magical artifact.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_20_Persuader_Normal	Text	All we need is to talk to him, and then we'll be on our way and you'll never see us again.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_21_Lizzaria_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success	Text	I can't get you in to see the master, but I can help.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_21_Lizzaria_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success2	Text	There are some things you should know.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_22_Persuader_Normal	Text	What things?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_23_Lizzaria_NPC_Persuasion_25_Falure	Text	You must think I'm a complete idiot.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_24_Lizzaria_NPC	Text	Kill them all!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_25_Deceiver_Normal	Text	Look, whatever you do in the privacy of your own castle is your own business…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_26_Deceiver_Normal	Text	…as long as you don't do it to us, of course.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_27_Deceiver_Normal	Text	But the thing is, we've come a very long way…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_27_Deceiver_Normal2	Text	…and it's vitally important that we speak to Master Mardracht.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_28_Lizzaria_NPC	Text	Really?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_29_Deceiver_Normal	Text	Oh, yes - it's a matter of life and - well, you know what I mean.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_30_Lizzaria_NPC	Text	What's it about?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_31_Deceiver_Normal	Text	Ah - I'm sorry. Really. But our orders are to speak only to him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_31_Deceiver_Normal2	Text	They come from the very highest level.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_32_Lizzaria_NPC	Text	I can't get you in to see the master, but I can help.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_32_Lizzaria_NPC2	Text	There are some things you should know.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_34_Lizzaria_NPC	Text	Well, in that case, go straight upstairs and ask for Aksha.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_34_Lizzaria_NPC2	Text	If anyone can persuade the master, she can.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_35_Lizzaria_NPC	Text	If you want to talk to Mardracht, you'll have to get past Aksha. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_36_Starter_Normal	Text	Who's Aksha?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_37_Lizzaria_NPC	Text	A defiler. She lives upstairs. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_38_Lizzaria_NPC	Text	She turned up a few years ago, seemed interested in the work, offered to help out…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_39_Lizzaria_NPC	Text	…and suddenly she'd installed herself upstairs and no one talked to the master except through her. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_40_Lizzaria_NPC	Text	I haven't seen Mardracht face to face since she got here. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_41_Lizzaria_NPC	Text	She says she takes messages to him, and she brings messages back…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_41_Lizzaria_NPC2	Text	…but they don't sound like him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_42_Lizzaria_NPC	Text	I know - knew him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_42_Lizzaria_NPC2	Text	He was my mentor, my teacher.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_42_Lizzaria_NPC3	Text	She's holding him prisoner, I'm certain.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_43_Starter_Normal	Text	So we'll have to go through her? 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_44_Lizzaria_NPC	Text	If you can. She's got a pack of ghouls…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_44_Lizzaria_NPC2	Text	…and those defiler powers of hers are no joke, either.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_45_Lizzaria_NPC	Text	We've tried using force before, more than once…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_45_Lizzaria_NPC2	Text	…but I got sick of losing people. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_46_Starter_Normal	Text	Thanks for the warning.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_46_Starter_Normal2	Text	Now, suppose we do manage to reach Master Mardracht…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_47_Starter_Normal	Text	…what's the best way to approach him? 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_48_Lizzaria_NPC	Text	Hard to say.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_48_Lizzaria_NPC2	Text	The Cataclysm hit him hard…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_48_Lizzaria_NPC3	Text	…and then Aksha - who knows what she's done to him? 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_49_Lizzaria_NPC	Text	The stairs will take you to her apartments. Good luck getting past her. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_01_Aksha_NPC	Text	Well. Lizzaria's taste in minions seems to be improving.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_02_Starter	Text	We're no one's minions, lady.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_03_Aksha_NPC	Text	You defeated her, then? I'm almost impressed.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_04_INTIMIDATE_CHOICE	Text	Step away!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_05_KILL_CHOICE	Text	We'll destroy you!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_06_PERSUADE_CHOICE	Text	We just want to talk to Mardracht.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_07_DECEIVE_CHOICE	Text	We can offer you blood.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_08_Intimidate_Defult	Text	We need to speak to your master.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_08_Intimidate2_Defult	Text	You can get out of our way or try to stop us.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_09_Deceive_Default	Text	Let's trade. If you help us, we can help you.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_10_Persuade_Default	Text	We ask a simple boon:
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_10_Persuade_Default2	Text	An audience with Master Mardracht, and safe passage out of the castle.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_11_Kill_Default	Text	We'll leave an impression on you, too - a deep and bloody one!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_12_Aksha_NPC_Intimidation_25_Success	Text	I'm in a generous mood today. Go ahead - but don't expect to get any sense out of the old coward.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_13_Default_Default	Text	What does that mean - getting sense out of him?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_14_Aksha_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure	Text	Kill them! Kill them all!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_15_Aksha_NPC	Text	Trade? What do you have that I could possibly want?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_16_Deceiver_Normal	Text	(low voice) How about blood?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_16_Deceiver_Normal2	Text	Not mine, of course…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_16_Deceiver_Normal3	Text	…but get me in to see Mardracht and the others are all yours.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_17_Aksha_NPC	Text	You'd sell the lives of your companions to see one crazy old wizard?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_18_Deceiver_Normal	Text	Crazy? What do you mean?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_19_Aksha_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure	Text	You must think I was born yesterday…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_20_Persuader_Normal	Text	We believe your master knows about a powerful ancient artifact.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_20_Persuader_Normal2	Text	We need his knowledge.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_21_Aksha_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success	Text	Hm. Your puny minds couldn't comprehend what he once knew.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_22_Aksha_NPC	Text	Now, it's a good day if he knows who I am.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_23_Persuader_Normal	Text	What do you mean?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_24_Aksha_NPC	Text	You'll see.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_25_Aksha_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure	Text	Let me think…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_26_Aksha_NPC	Text	He's sealed his apartments off with powerful magic.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_26_Aksha_NPC2	Text	Keeps raving about gods coming to get him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_27_Aksha_NPC	Text	The Minor Gate is the only way in.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_28_Default_Default	Text	Minor Gate?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_29_Aksha_NPC	Text	Yes. Over there.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_01_Mardracht_NPC	Text	Who are you? How did you get in here?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_02_Default_Default	Text	Master Mardracht?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_03_Mardracht_NPC	Text	You know my name! How do you know my name?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_04_Default_Default	Text	We represent the Legacy Council, Master - and we mean you no harm.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_05_Mardracht_NPC	Text	No harm? No harm, they say - they always say that, always. They lie!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_06_Mardracht_NPC	Text	Get out! I can still defend myself, you know!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_07_INTIMIDATE_CHOICE	Text	Can't you see we're too strong?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_08_PERSUADE_CHOICE	Text	We don't want to kill you.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_09_DECEIVE_CHOICE	Text	We want to save Solasta.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_10_Intimidate_Default	Text	We found you and we breached your defenses.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_10_Intimidate_Default2	Text	Do you really want to test your power against ours?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_11_Deceive_Default	Text	You are right to fear us, and those who sent us.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_11_Deceive_Default2	Text	We are powerful - but you don't have to die.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_12_Persuade_Default	Text	All we ask is that you hear what we have to say.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_12_Persuade_Default2	Text	After that, we'll leave you in peace if that's what you want.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_13_Mardracht_NP	Text	If you are not here to kill me - then what?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_14_Intimidator_Normal	Text	I offer you the chance to buy your life.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_14_Intimidator_Normal2	Text	Will you take it? Will you give up your gem?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_15_Mardracht_NPC_Intimidate_25_Success	Text	For my life? I… 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_16_Mardracht_NPC_Intimidate_25_Failure	Text	Lies! All lies! I know your gods and their treachery!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_17_Deceive_Default	Text	The gods have commanded us to kill you…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_18_Mardracht_NPC	Text	I knew it!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_19_Deceiver_Normal	Text	…but we don't need to do that - if you'll help us.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_20_Deceiver_Normal	Text	We must have the Gem of Necromancy.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_21_Mardracht_NPC	Text	The gem… ? But…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_22_Deceiver_Normal	Text	But without your gem, we can't remake the Crown.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_22_Deceiver_Normal2	Text	Without the Crown, we can't defeat the gods.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_23_Mardracht_NPC_Deception_25_Success	Text	I… The gods? I don't… the Crown?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_24_Mardracht_NPC_Deception_25_Failure	Text	You have the Crown? No!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_25_Mardracht_NPC	Text	I see through your lies! Your evil gods want its power to destroy me!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_25_Mardracht_NPC2	Text	To destroy Solasta!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_26_Persuade_Default	Text	We are here to ask about the Crown of the Magister…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_26_Persuade_Default2	Text	…specifically, about the Gem of Necromancy.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_27_Mardracht_NPC	Text	What? What do you know of the Crown? What are you plotting?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_28_Persuader_Normal	Text	We're not plotting anything. We don't really know what's going on.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_29_Persuader_Normal	Text	But the Crown found us, and it seems that it wants to be whole again.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_30_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success	Text	But wait - the Crown is active?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_30_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success2	Text	And it chose you?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_31_Persuader_Normal	Text	Well… Yes. We're not sure why.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_32_Mardracht_NPC	Text	The very existence of Solasta must be threatened!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_33_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure	Text	Give me the Crown!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_33_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure2	Text	This is no task for the likes of you!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_34_Mardracht_NPC	Text	I must find the other Masters! Give me the Crown!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_35_Persuader_Normal	Text	But… ?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_36_Mardracht_NPC	Text	NOW!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_37_Mardracht_NPC	Text	This is what you came for.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_38_Mardracht_NPC	Text	Take it - and leave me alone!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle1_Any_Default	Text	The gem's in the castle?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle2_Any_Default	Text	Maybe. It's in that direction.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle3_Any_Default	Text	That's a good-sized castle. A garrison of two dozen at least.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle4_Any_Default	Text	There's a path to the right. Maybe we can find cover, and size the place up without being seen.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle5_Any_Default	Text	We could just show our Legacy Council credentials.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle6_Any_Default	Text	Assuming they're law-abiding folk who'll respect the Council… 
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle7_Any_Default	Text	…Not too many of those around here, I'm guessing.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate1_Any_Default	Text	We're not getting in that way.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate2_Any_Default	Text	Could we climb up?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate3_Any_Default	Text	It's too open. We'd be easy targets.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate4_Any_Default	Text	We'll have to find another way.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs1_Any_Default	Text	Remember the way we've come. I wouldn't want to get lost down here.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs2_Any_Default	Text	Typical First Expansion architecture, with some embellishments…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs3_Any_Default	Text	…probably used right up to the Cataclysm.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs4_Any_Default	Text	Great idea! Let's walk through the catacombs, talking loudly!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs5_Any_Default	Text	Everyone knows the undead are deaf!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry1_Any_Default	Text	Another door.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry2_Any_Default	Text	Oh, good. Just when I was thinking it would be too easy.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry3_Any_Default	Text	Look at the top. What is that?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry4_Any_Default	Text	Looks like a magical shield of some sort.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry5_Any_Default	Text	Some sort? How many sorts are there?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry6_Any_Default	Text	What we're looking for is up there.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry7_Any_Default	Text	You're sure?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry8_Any_Default	Text	It's obvious - the best loot gets the best protection.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_05_Well1_Any_Default	Text	This could be our way in.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_05_Well2_Any_Default	Text	Perfect. We climb down a wet, slippery, stone shaft…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_05_Well3_Any_Default	Text	…into water that's who knows how deep…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_05_Well4_Any_Default	Text	…and hope there's a way out. What could possibly go wrong?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain1_Any_Default	Text	This drain could be a way in.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain2_Any_Default	Text	Into what? The bathroom's one way, and the cesspool the other?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain3_Any_Default	Text	Suppose we get down there and it's just six-inch pipes?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain4_Any_Default	Text	Then we'll look for another way in. But let's try it first!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside1_Any_Default	Text	That doesn't look right.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside2_Any_Default	Text	It's a drain. What's wrong with that?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside3_Any_Default	Text	Yes, but inside a building?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside4_Any_Default	Text	Maybe the roof leaks.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside5_Any_Default	Text	Maybe this was a stock shed. A drain can be handy for mucking out.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside6_Any_Default	Text	That one's big enough for a cow to fall down. Doesn't make sense.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside7_Any_Default	Text	Unless…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside8_Any_Default	Text	I swear, if you say something smart…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside9_Any_Default	Text	I never say anything that's not. But think about it:
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside10_Any_Default	Text	It's big enough to climb down. It's hidden in a building. And it's close to both the walls and the keep.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside11_Any_Default	Text	Are you saying it's a secret entrance?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs1_Any_Default	Text	The outside graves were likely for servants and guards.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs2_Any_Default	Text	The mausoleum holds a few burials, but its main purpose is to hide this secret entrance.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs3_Any_Default	Text	The most important graves are in the catacombs down below.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs4_Any_Default	Text	And by "important," you mean "rich."
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter1_Any_Default	Text	So - this is a Minor Gate?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter2_Any_Default	Text	And we're sure it goes where the defiler woman said it goes?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter3_Any_Default	Text	Did you see any other way to get there?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter4_Any_Default	Text	So we're just going to trust her?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter5_Any_Default	Text	That looks like a Minor Gate.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter6_Any_Default	Text	Where do you suppose it goes?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter7_Any_Default	Text	To the Master's floor, hopefully.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter8_Any_Default	Text	Or into the heart of a volcano or somewhere equally unpleasant.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter9_Any_Default	Text	We've heard how paranoid this Master is.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter10_Any_Default	Text	So - are we going?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter11_Any_Default	Text	Why don't you go first? If it's somewhere nice, you can come back and tell us.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd1_Any_Default	Text	So that's it?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd2_Any_Default	Text	Yes? I can feel its power. It's… incredible!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd3_Any_Default	Text	Don't let it overwhelm you. Necromancy is dark magic.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd4_Any_Default	Text	That's right. We should probably sell it. How much do you think a smallish palace costs these days?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd5_Any_Default	Text	Stop it. You know we can't do that.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd6_Any_Default	Text	We must get it back to the Council.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd7_Any_Default	Text	Can't blame me for trying.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar1_Any_Default	Text	Ugh. Teleporting feels weird.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar2_Any_Default	Text	I wonder what this Mardracht is like?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar3_Any_Default	Text	If he fought at the Rift, imagine the stories he has to tell!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar4_Any_Default	Text	Dropping in unannounced on a paranoid recluse with untold magical powers. What could possibly go wrong?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones011_Any_Default	Text	It's a book!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones012_Any_Default	Text	You're amazing! Just one look, and you knew!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones013_Any_Default	Text	That's the sigil of the Antiquarians on the cover!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones014_Any_Default	Text	It's in the common tongue: "The Journal of Angbi Kramsson."
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones015_Any_Default	Text	Those must be his bones here.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones016_Any_Default	Text	I bet the Antiquarians would like to have this.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones017_Any_Default	Text	That was the ghost we met earlier! 
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText011_Any_Default	Text	What's this?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText012_Any_Default	Text	Going out on a limb, here - but I *think* it's a piece of parchment.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText013_Any_Default	Text	You're not as funny as you think you are.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText014_Any_Default	Text	It's high elven. Looks like notes for some kind of experiment.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText015_Any_Default	Text	Like, for example, doing unspeakable magical things to dead bodies?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText021_Any_Default	Text	What's this? 
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText022_Any_Default	Text	It's a journal. Look - dates here, and entries there.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText023_Any_Default	Text	What language is this?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText024_Any_Default	Text	Draconic. They say it's older than high elven.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText025_Any_Default	Text	Hm. Some scholars use obscure languages to prevent others stealing their research.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText026_Any_Default	Text	Well, everyone said he was paranoid.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText027_Any_Default	Text	Or… 
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText028_Any_Default	Text	What? He's a dragon? How would that work?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText029_Any_Default	Text	The most powerful dragons can take any form they choose. Why not an elf?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText0210_Any_Default	Text	That's pretty far-fetched. He probably just learned draconic.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil1_Any_Default	Text	That looks weird.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil2_Any_Default	Text	It's similar to some magical wards I've seen, but…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil3_Any_Default	Text	Don't touch it! Don't go near it! Don't even look at it!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil4_Any_Default	Text	It hasn't done anything yet.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil5_Any_Default	Text	It doesn't work? I wonder…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil6_Any_Default	Text	Don't. Just don't.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil7_Any_Default	Text	Perhaps he made a *spelling* mistake!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil8_Any_Default	Text	I hate you.

Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_2_Pragmatism_Default	Text	Better be sure!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_3_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Who art thou?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_4_AcademicOrElse_Default	Text	Old elvish! We are friends, my lady!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_5_Kythaela_NPC	Text	The Master sent you?  
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_6_Any_Default	Text	Which Master? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_7_Kythaela_NPC	Text	How dare you!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_8_Pragmatism_Default	Text	Dare what? Come outside and look around!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_9_Kythaela_NPC	Text	But it's… impossible!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_10_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Where am I?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_11_Pragmatism_Slang	Text	It's called the Badlands!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_12_Kythaela_NPC	Text	No! I was in the Aer-Elai, the heart of the Empire!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_13_Kythaela_NPC	Text	I must find the Master!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_14_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Kythaela, my name is the shield…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_15_Kythaela_NPC	Text	…no, my name is Kythaela of the shield…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_16_Kythaela_NPC	Text	…whatever this shield might be. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_17_Choice1_WRITTEN	Text	Which Master? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_18_Choice2_WRITTEN	Text	Aer-Elai?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_19_Choice3_WRITTEN	Text	A shield?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_20_Choice1_Spoken	Text	Which Master are you talking about?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_21_Choice2_Spoken	Text	Aer-Elai? The heart of the Empire? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_22_Choice3_Spoken	Text	What is this shield you're talking about?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_23_Kythaela_NPC	Text	The Master of… I can't remember. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_24_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Yes, this tower was in the Aer-Elai, a haven of peace!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_25_Kythaela_NPC	Text	The shield is the master, and the master is the shield! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_26_Kythaela_NPC	Text	But tell me - what happened? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_27_Any_Default	Text	A thousand years ago, the Cataclysm ravaged the Empire.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_28_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Cataclysm? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_29_Helpfulness_Default	Text	My lady, what is the last thing you remember? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_30_Kythaela_NPC	Text	I don't remember any Cataclysm… I remember… a large room…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_31_Kythaela_NPC	Text	…people speaking about a rift, a great threat to the Empire…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_32_Kythaela_NPC	Text	…strange creatures with strange powers…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_33_Choice_Academic_WRITTEN	Text	You mean THE Rift?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_34_Choice_Academic_Spoken	Text	A rift? Do you mean THE rift? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_35_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Are there more than one?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_36_Choice2_WRITTEN	Text	Creatures? The Soraks?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_37_Choice2_Spoken	Text	Strange creatures - yes, the Soraks, of course! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_38_Kythaela_NPC	Text	No - they were called… humans…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_39_Kythaela_NPC	Text	…strange beings, with magic that was not arcane. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_40_Kythaela_ifHumanAdventurer_NPC	Text	They actually looked just like you!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_41_AcademicOrElse_Default	Text	Fascinating! You witnessed a council of war! Can you recall anything else?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_42_Kythaela_NPC	Text	One of the beings was wearing THIS Crown, scintillating with gems. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_43_Kythaela_NPC	Text	They called him Magister, with the utmost respect! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_44_Kythaela_NPC	Text	But you are not him. Where did you find this Crown?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_45_Choice1_WRITTEN	Text	You met the Magister?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_46_Choice1_Spoken	Text	The Magister? And this was his Crown?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_47_Choice2_WRITTEN	Text	Scintillating?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_48_Choice2_Spoken	Text	Scintillating with gems, you say?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_49_Choice3_WRITTEN	Text	We found this Crown.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_50_Choice3_Spoken	Text	We found this Crown in another part of the Badlands.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_51_Kythaela_NPC	Text	He was wearing it, at least.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_52_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Yes. The Crown was set with eight large gems.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_53_Kythaela_NPC	Text	There are no Badlands!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_54_SellswordOrElse_Slang	Text	Just look outside, lady! The Badlands are real! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_55_SellswordOrElse_Slang	Text	And we had to fight Soraks to get the Crown!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_56_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Soraks?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_57_Any_Default	Text	The scourge of humanity.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_58_Any_Default	Text	They ran the humans out of Tirmar…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_59_Any_Default	Text	…and came here to finish the job!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_60_Kythaela_NPC	Text	The humans weren't the enemy? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_61_Choice1_WRITTEN	Text	They were refugees!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_62_Choice1_Spoken	Text	No! They were refugees, fleeing the Soraks!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_63_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Refugees? Eager to join the enlightenment of the Empire!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_64_AcademicOrElse_Default	Text	Slavery isn't enlightenment! Those days died with the Empire!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_65_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Silence, wretch! The Empire can't be dead!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_66_Any_NonHighElf_Rude	Text	The Empire died with the Cataclysm! And even if it galls me to admit it…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_67_AcademicOrElse_Default	Text	…it saved Solasta from a horrible fate!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_68_Choice2_WRITTEN	Text	They warned the Empire.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_69_Choice2_Spoken	Text	They convinced the Empire of the real threat.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_70_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Those Soraks you mentioned?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_71_AcademicOrElse_Default	Text	Yes! Dangerous, evil lizards, able to wield magic and to subvert minds!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_72_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Weak human minds, for sure! And yet…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_73_AcademicOrElse_Default	Text	And yet?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_74_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Yet I recall an elf, a member of the household, trying to kill the Master…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_75_Choice3_WRITTEN	Text	They joined forces.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_76_Choice3_Spoken	Text	Their combined forces assaulted the Rift. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_77_Kythaela_NPC	Text	There was mention of the Rift in the Aer-Elai.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_78_Any_Default	Text	They managed to close it - but triggered the Cataclysm, ushering in a dark age!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_79_Kythaela_NPC	Text	The dark age? Those Badlands you mentioned?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_80_Any_NPC	Text	Yes! A thousand years of rebuilding after near extinction!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_81_Kythaela_NPC	Text	It can't be! I still feel the Master!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_82_Kythaela_NPC	Text	And I must find him!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_83_Any_Default	Text	Times have changed since you last traveled in the Empire…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_84_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Still, I feel the pull! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_85_Any_Default	Text	The pull?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_86_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Yes, a pull to get to the Copper Vale of Remembrance! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_87_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Take me there at once and I shall name you favored servants!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_88_Crownbearer_Default	Text	The Copper Vale of Remembrance? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_89_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Yes - a fortress and place of rest for fallen heroes, roughly in this direction!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_90_Choice1_WRITTEN	Text	The Vale of Coparann?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_91_Choice1_Spoken	Text	Copper, fortress… hmmm - sounds like the Vale of Coparann!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_92_Choice2_WRITTEN	Text	We're not your servants.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_93_Choice2_Spoken	Text	We are no one's servants, favored or otherwise!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_94_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Traveling companions, then!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_95_Kythaela_NPC	Text	You can tell me of this Cataclysm on our journey!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_96_Choice3_WRITTEN	Text	You seem sure we'll agree.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_97_Choice3_Spoken	Text	You seem very certain that we'll go with you.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_98_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Of course - you wouldn't let a lady cross those Badlands alone, surely? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_1Galar_NPC	Text	A timely arrival! Many thanks for your help! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_2_Pragmatism_Default	Text	Clear skies, friend! What's going on here? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_3Galar_NPC	Text	Those… fellows joined my caravan at Coparann…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_4Galar_NPC	Text	…a couple of hours ago, this man stumbled on our path, almost dead…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_5Galar_NPC	Text	…no healing could help him, so I put him in a tent…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_6Galar_NPC	Text	…and I was about to send word to Coparann.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_7_Choice1Pragmatism_WRITTEN	Text	Coparann?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_8_Choice1Pragmatism_Spoken	Text	Coparann? That's where we're going!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_9Galar_NPC	Text	Then perhaps you can do me a favor! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_10_CynicismOrElse_Default	Text	A favor? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_11Galar_NPC	Text	Of course I'll see that you're rewarded! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_12_Choice2Starter_WRITTEN	Text	Almost dead?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_13_Choice2Starter_Spoken	Text	Almost dead? Sick? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_14Galar_NPC	Text	No, wounded! Deep wounds…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_15Galar_NPC	Text	…ripped open, as if by sharp claws.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_16Galar_NPC	Text	We found him near the road. It looked like he had crawled there.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_17_LawkeeperorElse_Default	Text	Claw wounds? And no healing could help him? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_18Galar_NPC	Text	That's right. The wounds were oozing.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_19Galar_NPC	Text	It's a wonder he was still alive.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_20_Choice3Spy_WRITTEN	Text	Send word? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_21_Choice3Spy_Spoken	Text	Why send word?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_22Galar_NPC	Text	Because this man was a corporal in the Coparann Watch. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_23_Starter_Default	Text	You want us to take word of his death to Coparann.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_24Galar_NPC	Text	Yes - take this note and his personal effects to Sergeant Nikannen.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_25Galar_NPC	Text	Have him countersign the note, then see my agent.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_26Galar_NPC	Text	He is the owner of the general store. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_27Galar_NPC	Text	Meanwhile, get some rest and share our camp!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_28Galar_NPC	Text	We can even sell you some equipment!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_29_ArunFollower_Default	Text	Let us share Arun's gifts!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_30_Any_Default	Text	Many thanks for your hospitality!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_1_Guard_NPC	Text	Halt! Do you seek entrance to our fair valley?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_2_Any_Default	Text	Yes, we do!

Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_4_Any_Default	Text	Thank you! Clear skies! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_5_Guard_NPC	Text	Stay in the light!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_6_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	Good day! I am Sergeant Nikannen, officer of the day! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_7_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	What business brings you to Coparann?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_8_SellswordChoice1_WRITTEN	Text	We found something.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_9_SellswordOrElse_Slang	Text	Well, Sarge, we found something of yours on our way here!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_10_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	Of mine? What, exactly?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_11_AcademicChoice2_WRITTEN	Text	We have something for you.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_12_AcademicChoice2_Default	Text	We were asked to give you certain items! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_13_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	Asked? By whom?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_14_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	And what items?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_15_SpyOrElse_WRITTEN	Text	Galar sent us.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_16_SpyOrElse_Default	Text	Master Galar Goldentongue asked us to see you - and to bring these…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_17_SellswordOrElse_Slang	Text	Here they are, Sarge!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_18_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	The ring, the badge, the insignia…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_19_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	The man who wore those was of middling height…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_20_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	…broad shoulders, dark hair, and a broken nose. Am I right?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_21_SpyorElse_Default	Text	Correct! You knew him, then?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_22_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	He broke his nose after an… exchange of views behind the barracks.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_23_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	Roald tried to headbutt his basic training instructor. That was me!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_24_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	Now, tell me what happened to my good friend Roald!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_25_DiplomatOrElse_Default	Text	First, please accept our sincere condolences! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_26_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	Thanks. Now tell me where, when, how - and who!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_27_DiplomatOrElse_Default	Text	Two days ago.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_28_SpyOrElse_Default	Text	It was at a small camp in some Manacalon ruins. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_29_SpyOrElse_Default	Text	He was found almost dead by the caravan people.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_30_SpyOrElse_Default	Text	They tried to heal him and then…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_31_SpyOrElse_Default	Text	…some travelers in the caravan rushed in…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_32_SpyOrElse_Default	Text	…to kill your friend and the guards Master Galar had posted!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_33_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	And no idea who those guys were? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_34_SellswordOrElse_Default	Text	No, Sarge. They looked like common mercs to me! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_35_SgtNikannen_Default	Text	Did Roald say anything to you? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_37_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	Dire news. Listen - go and speak to the Ceannard. Tell him everything…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_38_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	…but leave Gromnir out of it for now.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_38_AcademicOrElse_WRITTEN	Text	The Ceannard?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_39_AcademicOrElse_Spoken	Text	The Ceannard?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_39_AristocratOrElse_WRITTEN	Text	Not the Baron?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_40_AristocratOrElse_Spoken	Text	And why not the Baron?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_41_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	The Ceannard is the ruler of the Vale of Coparann.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_42_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	Talk to the Ceannard first and then…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_43_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	…perhaps we can discuss some more!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_44_AcademicOrElse_Default	Text	And where is the Ceannard? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_45_Kythaela_NPC	Text	But we need to talk to the Baron!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_46_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	You can find him at the Town Hall at this hour.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_47_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	Give him this note from me and tell him exactly what happened.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_48_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	You won't talk to him without my leave…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_49_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	Talk to the Ceannard first and then…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_50_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	Here - my signature on the letter from Galar…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_51_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	Take it to Master Warmhearth at the general store.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_52_SgtNikannen_NPC	Text	And here's a note for the Ceannard!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_53_Any_Default	Text	Stay in the light!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_1_Ceannard_NPC	Text	Clear skies! Joris Nikannen says you have an interesting story to tell! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_2_Any_Default	Text	Clear skies to you, my lord!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_3_Any_Default	Text	Well, it all began when we came upon this caravan…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_4_Ceannard_NPC	Text	Go on.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_5_Ceannard_NPC	Text	Hmm… military matters I usually leave in the more than competent hands of the Baron…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_6_Ceannard_NPC	Text	…but Nikannen sent you to me.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_7_Ceannard_NPC	Text	You see, he is a rarity in the Stonefist Mercenary company…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_8_Ceannard_NPC	Text	…the one old hand who was born here. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_9_Ceannard_NPC	Text	We have known each other almost all our lives!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_10_Ceannard_NPC	Text	He is the reason Stonefist came to our aid during the orc invasion.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_11_Ceannard_NPC	Text	And he sent you to me? That's odd! Why did you come to Coparann? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_12_Sellsword_WRITTEN	Text	The Stonefist company? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_13_Sellsword_Spoken	Text	The Stonefist mercenary company? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_14_Ceannard_NPC	Text	Our military force, since they helped us repel the orc invasion!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_15_Academic_WRITTEN	Text	Orc invasion? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_16_Academic_Spoken	Text	An orc invasion? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_17_Ceannard_NPC	Text	Happened about fifteen years ago. Several tribes got together…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_18_Ceannard_NPC	Text	…whipped into a frenzy by a shaman.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_19_Ceannard_NPC	Text	They hit us hard and opened a breach…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_20_Ceannard_NPC	Text	…got a foothold in the outer works, and were about to hit the town. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_21_Ceannard_NPC	Text	Then Gromnir hit them from behind, and they were between hammer and anvil!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_22_SpyOrElse_WRITTEN	Text	Stonefist?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_23_SpyOrElse_Spoken	Text	Who's Stonefist?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_24_Ceannard_NPC	Text	Gromnir Stonefist, founder of the Stonefist mercenary company!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_Exit_WRITTEN	Text	That doesn't answer my question.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_26_Highclass_Spoken	Text	We are agents of the Legacy Council.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_27_Highclass_Default	Text	Our current mission is to escort Lady Kythaela.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_28_Highclass_Default	Text	Coparann was the seat of her family before the Cataclysm.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_29_Ceannard_NPC	Text	And Lady Kythaela is on a nostalgia trip? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_30_Highclass_Default	Text	Far from it! One of her ancestors left family heirlooms hidden in the fortress. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_31_Highclass_Default	Text	Among those heirlooms, we hope to find clues about the next stage of our quest!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_32_Ceannard_NPC	Text	Old elven nobility! I am sure I have never seen you before, Lady Kythaela. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_33_Ceannard_NPC	Text	So tell me something about Coparann that a newcomer or even a casual visitor couldn't know.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_34_Kythaela_NPC	Text	In a side valley, there is an Imperial mausoleum of Lanaerach, home of the honored dead!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_35_AcademicorElse_WRITTEN	Text	Mausoleum?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_36_AcademicorElse_Spoken	Text	A place of remembrance?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_37_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Yes, for the honored dead who fell in battle for the Empire. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_38_Ceannard_NPC	Text	There is indeed an ancient Imperial mausoleum in a side valley, sealed off since the Fall of Manacalon!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_39_Ceannard_NPC	Text	Not many know of it. Thank you, my lady - I am convinced.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_40_Sellsword_WRITTEN	Text	Lanaerach?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_41_Sellsword_Spoken	Text	What's Lanaerach?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_42_Ceannard_NPC	Text	A very particular kind of marble - very precious! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_43_Ceannard_NPC	Text	The traditional stone for the honored dead!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_44_Ceannard_NPC	Text	As for the rest of you, you said you were sent by the Legacy Council.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_45_Ceannard_NPC	Text	We see a lot of Council agents on their way to the Badlands, and they bring a lot of rumors.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_46_Ceannard_NPC	Text	So tell me - is there any truth to the rumor that the Soraks are back?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_47_AcademicorElse_Default	Text	Yes! And they are as nasty as legends made them! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_48_Ceannard_NPC	Text	Can they truly possess others?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_49_AcademicorElse_Default	Text	Not possess, exactly…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_50_AcademicorElse_Default	Text	…what they do is worse…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_51_AcademicorElse_Default	Text	…if you believe the tales that the paladins of Einar recovered from their archives. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_52_Ceannard_NPC	Text	Do me a favor: walk around our city, talk to the people…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_53_Ceannard_NPC	Text	…then report your impressions to Sergeant Nikannen.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_54_Ceannard_NPC	Text	Not a word about what you told me, though.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_55_Insight15Success_Default	Text	Do you believe the Soraks are in Coparann?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_56_Ceannard_NPC	Text	I'll say no more for the time being!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_57_Ceannard_NPC	Text	Walk the streets, then see Nikannen! Meanwhile, stay in the light! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_58_Crownbearer_Default	Text	Clear skies to you, Ceannard! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_1_Merchant1_NPC	Text	It's rather silly, really. This young man…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_2_Merchant1_NPC	Text	…he asked me for a specific design so he could propose…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_3_Merchant2_NPC	Text	So? He probably gambled the money away!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_4_Merchant1_NPC	Text	Not him! Straight arrow on the fast track to sergeant or higher! I asked around!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_5_Merchant2_NPC	Text	So? Where is this paragon of yours?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_6_Merchant1_NPC	Text	Consigned to guard duty! A whole week! And that just on his return from patrol! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_1_YoungMaid_NPC	Text	Sergeant, when can I see my Erik? He is due some liberty!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_2_Sergeant_NPC	Text	Gal, I already told ya! He's assigned to guard duty!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_3_YoungMaid_NPC	Text	A whole week of it - and that after two weeks on patrol! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_4_YoungMaid_NPC	Text	No - he just doesn't want to see me anymore.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_5_Sergeant_NPC	Text	Now, gal, don't you fret! It's not that at all.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_6_Sergeant_NPC	Text	The Old Man has had his whole patrol on guard duty in the basement ever since they came back! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_7_Sergeant_NPC	Text	Something's up - and whatever it is, it can't be good!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_1_Bartender_NPC	Text	Mistress Mildred! The brewer wants to know when to bring the next delivery of ale. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_2_Bartender_NPC	Text	He doesn't want it to go stale - he has his reputation to consider!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_3_Mildred_NPC	Text	If only Stonefist had let his thirsty patrol out on leave as usual…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_4_Mildred_NPC	Text	…but now, we've only the regulars and the ale's not moving too fast!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_5_Mildred_NPC	Text	Take him two empty barrels and get two new ones. It's the best we can do right now!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_1_Patron1_NPC	Text	Oh, the Ceannard's hopping mad!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_2_Patron2_NPC	Text	Why's that?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_3_Patron1_NPC	Text	A whole week he's been waiting - and still no meeting with the Baron!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_4_Patron2_NPC	Text	That's weird. Usually they meet every day, at least!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_5_Patron2_NPC	Text	Like an old couple, the two of them!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_1_Wilf_NPC	Text	Well met! What can we do for you on this fine morning?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_2_ChoiceA_WRITTEN	Text	We have a letter for you.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_3_ChoiceB_WRITTEN	Text	The Ceannard sent us.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_4_ChoiceC_WRITTEN	Text	Let's see your wares.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_4_ChoiceD_WRITTEN	Text	We should go.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_5_ChoiceA_Spoken	Text	Clear skies to you! Master Goldentongue sent this letter!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_6_Wilf_NPC	Text	Of course, of course!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_7_Wilf_NPC	Text	Yes - Master Goldentongue's instructions are quite clear!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_8_Wilf_NPC	Text	Here is your money - and here's a receipt to sign!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_9_Wilf_NPC	Text	Would you be interested in sampling our wares?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_10_Any_Default	Text	What do you sell?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_11_Wilf_NPC	Text	A pleasure doing business with you! Stay in the light! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_12_Any_Normal	Text	The Ceannard sent us to talk to you.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_13_Any_Normal	Text	Anything unusual in recent days?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_14_Wilf_NPC	Text	The Baron came back with a bunch of prisoners. Highwaymen, apparently.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_15_Wilf_NPC	Text	I'm wondering why they didn't hang them on the spot!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_16_Any_Normal	Text	Hanging, eh? Would that be the normal practice?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_17_Wilf_NPC	Text	Yes. You don't need that many prisoners to make them talk, if you ask me!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_1_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	Well met again!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_2_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	So - you've had a chance to walk around the city and hear what people are saying?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_3_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	What do you think?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_4_ChoiceA_WRITTEN	Text	The soldiers.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_5_SellswordOrElse_Normal	Text	Something is wrong. Soldiers back from a patrol denied leave…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_6_SellswordOrElse_Normal	Text	…posted to guard duty instead of visiting the tavern.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_7_ChoiceB_WRITTEN	Text	These highwaymen.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_8_ChoiceB_Spoken	Text	The story with the highwaymen is also weird. Why keep them prisoner?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_9_LawkeeperOrElse_Normal	Text	Normally the penalty is clear and swift. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_10_LawkeeperOrElse_Normal	Text	On the frontier, you don't feed idle people, particularly not scum like highwaymen.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_11_LawkeeperOrElse_Normal	Text	At best, you put them to work. At worst, they become fertilizer!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_12_Temp	Text	So what do you think?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_12_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	There are two things I didn't mention in our last conversation.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_13_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	Things about Roald and the Baron.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_14_ChoiceA_WRITTEN	Text	Roald?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_15_ChoiceA_Spoken	Text	What about Roald?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_16_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	When you told me of Roald's death and returned his personal effects…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_17_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	…I was speechless, not out of grief but…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_18_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	…because, not a week before, Roald had come back from patrol! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_19_Any_Default	Text	You mean… one of them is… not who he seems.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_20_ChoiceB_WRITTEN	Text	The Baron?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_21_ChoiceB_Spoken	Text	What about the Baron?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_22_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	I have known him for twenty years. I was a founding member of the company.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_23_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	Now, for the first time in ten years, I am officer of the day, posted here.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_24_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	And that's not all…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_25_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	For the last ten years he's always called me Joris. Now, all of a sudden it's back to Nikannen. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_26_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	Something is wrong. I can feel it. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_27_SellswordOrElse_Normal	Text	Suggestions, Sarge? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_28_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	The Ceannard mentioned your mission. He and I go way back. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_29_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	So - go see the baron and tell him your heirloom story.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_30_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	I know what his normal reaction would be…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_31_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	…so come back and we can compare notes. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_32_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	And if I were you, I wouldn't mention Roald, the caravan, or anything else…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_33_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Slang	Text	As the philosopher said, we must hang together or we'll hang separately! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_34_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	Clear skies to you! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_35_SellswordOrElse_Slang	Text	Clear skies, Sarge! Misaye's laughing!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_1_BaronStonefist_NPC	Text	Greetings, adventurers. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_2_BaronStonefist_NPC	Text	Sergeant Nikannen says you want to see me on some urgent matter?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_3_DiplomatOrAristocratOrElse_Normal	Text	Yes. It concerns our traveling companion, Lady Kythaela.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_4_BaronStonefist_NPC	Text	Then let her speak for herself!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_5_Kythaela_NPC	Text	My lord, before the Cataclysm this valley was in the care of my family. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_6_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Alas, only a few of us managed to survive - and none at all in the valley. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_7_BaronStonefist_NPC	Text	A sad tale, my lady, but not uncommon. Those were dire times.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_8_Kythaela_NPC	Text	My father passed away recently. Upon his death bed…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_9_Kythaela_NPC	Text	…he mentioned some family heirlooms left in a hidden room somewhere in the fortress. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_10_Kythaela_NPC	Text	With your leave, my lord…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_11_Kythaela_NPC	Text	…I would like to search for this hidden room and retrieve my family's belongings.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_12_BaronStonefist_NPC	Text	Out of the question! This is my castle and all in it belongs to me! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_13_BaronStonefist_NPC	Text	Now begone - and be glad that, as a guest, you are protected by our customs…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_14_BaronStonefist_NPC	Text	…otherwise, your impudence would land you in the dungeon!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_1_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	Ah - you're back! How did the audience go? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_2_CynicOrElse_Normal	Text	Clear skies! Well, he didn't imprison us, just threw us out! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_3_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	Just threw you out? That's not like him at all!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_4_CynicOrElse_Normal	Text	Oh? He's not always so generous to strangers?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_5_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	No - just pragmatic and smart! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_6_ChoiceA_WRITTEN	Text	Pragmatic?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_7_ChoiceA_Spoken	Text	Pragmatic?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_8_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	It would be cheaper to let you find the heirlooms, under close escort.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_9_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	He'd demand a fee, but it's easier than having to search for himself!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_10_ChoiceB_WRITTEN	Text	Smart?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_11_ChoiceB_Spoken	Text	Smart?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_12_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	Of course, smart! If we assume Lady Kythaela's story is true…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_13_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	…then arresting her or coercing her could have drawn the ire of an elven clan.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_14_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	A pretty stupid move for stuff which might only have sentimental value! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_15_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	So, not like Gromnir at all!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_16_SellswordOrElse_Normal	Text	Fine. What do you suggest? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_17_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	Let me make some preparations. You go back to him tomorrow…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_18_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	…as envoys of the Legacy Council!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_10_ChoiceC_WRITTEN	Text	So, what's the plan?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_1_Baron_NPC	Text	Sergeant Nikannen, why are you bringing these people to me again?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_2_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	My lord, they showed me credentials that I thought you should see.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_3_Baron_NPC	Text	Credentials? What do credentials have to do with Lady Kythaela's claims? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_4_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Formal	Text	We're from the Legacy Council.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_5_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Formal	Text	My lord, we are deputies of the Legacy Council!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_6_Baron_NPC	Text	And the Legacy Council interferes in Coparann's affairs?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_7_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal	Text	Quite the contrary, my lord…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_8_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal	Text	…the Council would appreciate Coparann's help.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_9_Baron_NPC	Text	Why didn't you say so yesterday? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_10_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal	Text	We do not flaunt our allegiance unless there is need, my lord!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_11_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal	Text	Lady Kythaela works for the Legacy Council.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_12_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal	Text	Lady Kythaela has agreed to help the Council…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_13_AcademicOrElse_Normal	Text	…in a delicate and vital matter.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_14_Baron_Normal	Text	And what's that?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_15_DiplomatOrElse_Normal	Text	Historical research.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_16_Baron_NPC	Text	Those… baubles have some historical value?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_17_DiplomatOrElse_Normal	Text	We believe so, my lord. We wouldn't be here otherwise.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_18_Baron_NPC	Text	Then why not just say so?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_19_DiplomatOrElse_Normal	Text	Confidential matters are best handled confidentially, my lord.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_20_Baron_NPC	Text	Then - ah, shall we search for these heirlooms together? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_21_Baron_NPC	Text	I shall escort you and we'll inventory the… historical items.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_22_Baron_NPC	Text	Then we can discuss a reasonable share for the keep.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_23_Kythaela_NPC	Text	That would be more than fair, my lord!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_24_Baron_NPC	Text	Then please lead the way! Where should we start? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_25_Kythaela_NPC	Text	In the basement, my lord! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_26_Baron_NPC	Text	Let's go, then! Nikannen, you were right to bring them to me! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_27_Baron_NPC	Text	Now, back to your post!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_28_SergeantNikannen_NPC	Text	Yes, my lord!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_29_MeetYouThere	Text	Go. I'll meet you in the basement.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_1_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Here! This is the place! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_2_Baron_NPC	Text	And so near the dungeons. How subtle - and fitting. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_3_Baron_NPC	Text	Please, Lady Kythaela, before we inventory your heirlooms…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_4_Baron_NPC	Text	…there is something I wish to show you.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_5_Baron_NPC	Text	You will find it interesting, hopefully.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_6_Baron_NPC	Text	So nice of you to drop by. 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_7_Baron_NPC	Text	Now we shall all have a nice, long chat together! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_8_Baron_NPC	Text	And you will tell us everything!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_9_Baron_NPC	Text	Ah - and guards… Gromnir has outlived his usefulness!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_10_EinarOrElse_Formal	Text	Einar be your judge! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_11_Baron_NPC	Text	And you will give me that Crown!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_12_SeeingTheBaron	Text	Is that… the Baron?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_1_Baron_NPC	Text	Lady Kythaela, dear friends - words aren't enough to convey my thanks! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_2_Baron_NPC	Text	Your swift action has saved my life - and our vale! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_3_Baron_NPC	Text	We shall be more wary of the Council's warnings…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_4_Baron_NPC	Text	…the Soraks are real.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_5_Baron_NPC	Text	This changes our position towards the Council.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_6_ChoiceA_WRITTEN	Text	Warnings?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_7_ChoiceB_WRITTEN	Text	About the Council…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_8_ChoiceC_WRITTEN	Text	About the Soraks…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_9_ChoiceA_Spoken	Text	The Council warned you?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_10_Baron_NPC	Text	Indeed. I thought they exaggerated, alas!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_11_Baron_NPC	Text	If anything, they weren't loud enough!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_12_DiplomatOrElse_Default	Text	But we can only warn! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_13_Ceannard_NPC	Text	You are right to do so, but in such matters, only conviction and proof are effective!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_14_SellswordOrElse_Slang	Text	Soraks are real - you saw them with your own eyes.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_15_DiplomatOrElse_Normal	Text	Their presence was a clear message: be wary! Be careful!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_16_Ceannard_NPC	Text	True! We won't let our guard down! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_17_Any_Default	Text	How does this change your position?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_18_Ceannard_NPC	Text	Coparann must stand with the Council!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_19_DiplomatOrElse_Normal	Text	Do you plan to join the Council?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_20_DiplomatOrElse_Normal	Text	Or simply to help us in our endeavors? 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_21_Ceannard_NPC	Text	We shall join! The discovery of the hidden Gate…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_22_Ceannard_NPC	Text	…will allow us to communicate swiftly!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_23_Ceannard_NPC	Text	But enough about matters of state!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_24_Baron_NPC	Text	The Ceannard has the right of it! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_25_Baron_NPC	Text	The only benefit of power is the ability to reward friends!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_26_Ceannard_NPC	Text	And true friends of Coparann you have proven to be!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_27_Cynic_Or_Else_Normal	Text	Thanks for your kind words! We feel quite rewarded.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_28_DiplomatOrElse_Normal	Text	Hush, you! Ceannard, Lord Stonefist - many thanks for your kind words!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_29_DiplomatOrElse_Normal	Text	And praise be your resilience, so we could rescue you alive!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_30_Baron_NPC	Text	That resilience would have amounted to nothing…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_31_Baron_NPC	Text	…without your insight and your courage! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_32_Baron_NPC	Text	You are hereby granted permanent citizenship of Coparann, with all associated rights!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_33_Baron_NPC	Text	As well as free use of our rediscovered Gate!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_34_Cynic_Or_Else_Normal	Text	The keys to the town, maybe?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_35_Baron_NPC	Text	And these gems from our mines are well suited to holding enchantments.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_36_Baron_NPC	Text	Go forth on your journey with our blessings!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_37_DiplomatOrElse_Normal	Text	Many thanks for your generous gifts! May Einar watch over Coparann!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_1_Kythaela_NPC	Text	This is the place!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_2_SpyOrRangerOrElse_Normal	Text	And it's had recent visitors. Look here in the mud - a boot print.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_3_Perception15Success_Normal	Text	And the rain has only just stopped! Let's be careful!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_4_Perception15Failure_Normal	Text	Difficult to read anything here.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_5_SpyOrRangerOrElse_Normal	Text	Lady Kythaela! Do you know how to enter the Tower?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_6_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Yes!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_7_Crownbearer_Normal	Text	Let's head there now! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_8_BroodB_NPC	Text	Not so fast!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_9_BroodD_NPC	Text	The feast is just starting!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_10_BroodF_NPC	Text	And you will make a nice main dish!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_1_Kythaela_NPC	Text	Master, here I am, at last!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_2_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	Kythaela, come to me! 
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_3_Starter_Normal	Text	Kythaela could use some healing, I think!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_6_Razan_NPC	Text	Yes, dazzle us! Allow me to thank you for your actions!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_7_Razan_NPC	Text	I have tried for years to open that door! And here you are!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_8_Razan_NPC	Text	An answer to my prayers! It would almost lead me to believe…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_9_Razan_NPC	Text	…in the benevolence of the gods! Albeit my very existence proves otherwise!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_1_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	You have my thanks, whoever you are.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_2_Crownbearer_Normal	Text	You're welcome, I guess. But your thanks for what exactly? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_3_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	For reuniting me with Kythaela.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_4_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	For dealing with this… foulness when I was incapacitated.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_5_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	This evil was new to me, not something Manacalon ever knew.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_6_ChoiceA_WRITTEN	Text	Reuniting? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_7_ChoiceA_Spoken	Text	Reunited with her?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_8_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	Yes, Kythaela was - or even is - a part of me! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_9_Judgmental_Normal	Text	Did you kill her? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_10_Self_PreservationOrElse_Normal	Text	Careful, now!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_11_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	No, It is also me speaking, my friend, and your care is much appreciated!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_12_Insight_20_Success_Normal	Text	Kythaela was your clone? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_13_Insight_20_Failure_Normal	Text	I don't understand what happened here!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_14_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	Kythaela was a last-ditch contingency - one I didn't truly think I would ever need!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_15_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	A vessel for my knowledge and memories!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_16_AcademicOrElse_Normal	Text	But how did she awaken, a thousand years after the Cataclysm? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_17_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	The revival process was tied to an ambient level of mana.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_18_AcademicOrElse_Normal	Text	Very high-level magic, then!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_19_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	One of the secrets of the Arcaneum, yes!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_20_ChoiceB_WRITTEN	Text	Incapacitated? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_21_ChoiceB_Normal	Text	Incapacitated? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_22_Adrasteia_Spoken	Text	Yes, the merging process takes time - time during which I was almost helpless!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_23_ChoiceC_WRITTEN	Text	Never seen such a creature?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_24_ChoiceC_Normal	Text	Never met such a creature before? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_25_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	No. Manacalon, for all its faults, revered life!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_26_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	This was a negation of life, an abomination!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_27_AcademicOrElse_Normal	Text	Manacalon? Are you one of the… ?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_28_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	Adrasteia the Prudent Shield, Master of Abjuration. In your debt, and at your service! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_29_AcademicOrElse_Normal	Text	You were at the battle of the Rift?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_30_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	Yes, and there I must apologize for Kythaela's misconceptions.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_31_AcademicOrElse_Normal	Text	Misconceptions? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_32_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	Yes. She was created with an elven personality, and carried certain… prejudices.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_33_AcademicOrElse_Normal	Text	Oh, that.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_34_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	The Empire wasn't kind to… other races.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_35_AcademicOrElse_Normal	Text	The humans surprised you, it seems.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_36_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	Yes - such bravery, such defiance! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_37_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	They all came together to save Solasta! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_38_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	The Golden Cavalry charging and breaking the lines of the Sorr-Akkath! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_39_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	The Iron Legions and the Shield Wall of the dwarves…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_40_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	…holding the enemy at bay, flank to flank!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_41_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	Our shock arcanists and the human paladins together…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_42_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	…giving their lives to give us a chance to close the Rift!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_43_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	And, as another wave came through…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_44_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	…one last throw of the dice…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_45_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	…one last surprise for the Sorr-Akkath! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_46_AcademicOrElse_Normal	Text	What was it?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_47_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	Kaseinax had us walking Solasta in elven form for so long…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_48_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	…but at this moment we resumed our true forms!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_49_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	To secure the Rift for a few crucial moments…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_50_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	…buying time with our lives in a furnace of magic and steel! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_51_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	So Kaseinax finished his ritual!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_52_AcademicOrElse_Normal	Text	With the gems.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_53_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	Take it, old friend, once again.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_54_Crownbearer_Normal	Text	Old friend?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_55_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	I feel your spirit in the Crown, Kaseinax! 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_56_AcademicOrElse_normal	Text	The Magister is still in the Crown? 
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_57_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	Enough talk of the past.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_58_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	Please accept these few tokens of my gratitude!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_58_Adrasteia_NPC2	Text	I must rest now. I foresee one last flight, when the need is greatest…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_59_Adrasteia_NPC	Text	…and for that, I will need all my strength.

Narration/&CradleOfFire_SavedBrok_44_Joker_Default	Text	Heart of the mountain... sounds charming. I'm in!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SavedBrok_45_Carver_Default	Text	I like caves.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bloodspear_1_Nosy_Default	Text	What's the flag?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bloodspear_2_Kebra_NPC	Text	Bloodspear. Warriors.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bloodspear_3_History_Default	Text	Aren't all orcs warriors?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bloodspear_4_Brok_NPC	Text	Bloodspear chief Edrof. A champion.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bloodspear_5_Pragmatic_Default	Text	So what's the plan?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bloodspear_6_Brok_NPC	Text	Edrof respect only strength.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bloodspear_7_Brok_NPC	Text	He supported Arrok the powerful. 
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bloodspear_8_Brok_NPC	Text	You defeat him in arena, I turn Bloodspear against Arrok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bloodspear_9_Pragmatic_Default	Text	You mean take control of his tribe?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bloodspear_10_Brok_NPC	Text	Who else? Even without Edrof, Bloodspear never follow nyarks.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bloodspear_11_Joker_Default	Text	Nyarks. That's us, just so you know. Probably means piece of...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bloodspear_12_Orcish_Default	Text	...It means non-orcs, that's all.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bloodspear_13_Joker_Default	Text	You speak orcish?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bloodspear_14_Orcish_Default	Text	Enough to know non-orc from piece of...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bloodspear_15_Joker_Default	Text	Really? Oh, please, what's the word? I must know!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bloodspear_16_Orcish_Default	Text	Stop it. Just stop.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearMeeting_1_Edrof_NPC	Text	Brok alive? Why nyarks?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearMeeting_2_Brok_NPC	Text	Nyarks serve Brok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearMeeting_3_Joker_Default	Text	What was that?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearMeeting_4_Edrof_NPC	Text	Suncloud have no orcs, just nyark slaves? Shame.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearMeeting_5_Brok_NPC	Text	My nyarks can beat Edrof in arena.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearMeeting_6_Edrof_NPC	Text	Rhhhhhaaaaaa! I kill all your nyarks!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearMeeting_7_Brok_NPC	Text	Arena challenge. Edrof can't say no.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearMeeting_8_Edrof_NPC	Text	Who is nyark champion?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearMeeting_9_Player1_WRITTEN	Text	That would be me.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearMeeting_10_Player2_WRITTEN	Text	Let me crush this orc.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearMeeting_11_Player3_WRITTEN	Text	Someone's got to do it.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearMeeting_12_Player4_WRITTEN	Text	I'll fight.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearMeeting_13_Chosen_Default	Text	I'll fight you, Edrof.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearMeeting_14_Edrof_NPC	Text	And I kill you, nyark slave!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_1_Kebra_NPC	Text	Bloodspear - you witness!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_2_Kebra_NPC	Text	Suncloud not dead! 
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_3_Kebra_NPC	Text	Suncloud nyark slaves defeat Edrof!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_4_Joker_Default	Text	Slaves, really? Do we have to go along with that?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_5_Pragmatic_Default	Text	It's that, or fight them all.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_6_Violent_Default	Text	Let's do that, then.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_7_Kebra_NPC	Text	Brok chief of Bloodspear now! 
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_8_Kebra_NPC	Text	Or anyone challenge the nyark for tribe staff?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_9_Kebra_NPC	Text	Good.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_10_Pragmatic_Default	Text	What now?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_11_Brok_NPC	Text	I stay. Kebra show you way.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_12_Choice1_WRITTEN	Text	Do we have to kill all other chiefs?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_13_Choice2_WRITTEN	Text	Can't we just find Arrok?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_14_Choice3_WRITTEN	Text	Fine.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_15_Choice1_Default	Text	So, do we do the same thing with all the other tribes?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_16_Brok_NPC	Text	Other tribes different. Not want challenge.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_17_Brok_NPC	Text	Kebra explain.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_18_Choice2_Default	Text	Seriously, can't we just go ahead and, you know, find Arrok and kill him?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_19_Brok_NPC	Text	Arrok has many warriors. We need all tribes.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_20_Brok_NPC	Text	But if you not trust Brok, go find Arrok and see.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BloodspearBeaten_21_Choice3_Default	Text	Fine, let's go.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bladefang_1_Default_Default	Text	This place is…different.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bladefang_2_history_Default	Text	Half Manacalon, half orc, all crazy.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bladefang_3_Violent_Default	Text	Another tribe we need to make friends with?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bladefang_4_acolyte_Default	Text	Converting them seems unlikely, so...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bladefang_5_Kebra_NPC	Text	Bladefang is tribe of faithful.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bladefang_6_Kebra_NPC	Text	They worship relics of times before.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bladefang_7_Default_Default	Text	Meaning… before the Cataclysm?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bladefang_8_History_Default	Text	I don't think the Manacalons  would be friendly with orcs.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bladefang_9_Carver_Default	Text	They weren't even friendly with their own mothers.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bladefang_10_Kebra_NPC	Text	Bladefang shaman build cult with relics. Treats old stones like holy.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bladefang_11_Cynical_Default	Text	Just like the antiquarians. We should introduce them to Halman Summer.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bladefang_12_Pragmatic_Default	Text	So what's the trick this time?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bladefang_13_Kebra_NPC	Text	The crown. It will impress.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bladefang_14_Selfpres_Default	Text	What do you know about our crown?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bladefang_15_Kebra_NPC	Text	Ancient power. Feel it. Very strong.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bladefang_16_Nosy_Default	Text	You can feel its power?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bladefang_17_Kebra_NPC	Text	Orc shamans can detect magic like you...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bladefang_18_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Of course...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bladefang_19_Kebra_NPC	Text	I know shaman wants something found.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Bladefang_20_Any_Default	Text	Fine, let's go.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_1_Radulf_NPC	Text	Stop, Kebra!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_2_Kebra_NPC	Text	Coming in peace with nyark of ancients.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_3_Radulf_NPC	Text	Brok! You alive! But your tribe dead.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_4_Brok_Default	Text	Not dead yet. Powerful allies now.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_5_Radulf_Default	Text	Not enough to stop Arrok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_6_Joker_Default	Text	With Bladefang, Brok may be strong enough.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_7_Radulf_Default	Text	Signs are with Arrok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_8_Cynical_Default	Text	He's good, this shaman. Guy burns down a whole tribe, and he sees the signs.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_9_Authority_Default	Text	Shut up.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_10_Radulf_NPC	Text	Arrok has stone of power.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_11_Kebra_NPC	Text	Nyarks have stones of power. More than Arrok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_12_Radulf_NPC	Text	Bladefang not follow Brok - yet.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_13_Radulf_NPC	Text	Nyarks prove power first.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_14_Radulf_NPC	Text	Bring back the holy axe of the ancients.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_15_Kebra_NPC	Text	Can't ask that! Kralshe-renn's have holy axe in lair.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_16_Radulf_NPC	Text	If nyarks have power to defeat Arrok...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_17_Radulf_NPC	Text	...then nyarks can kill Kralshe-renn.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_18_Orcish_Default	Text	Kralshe-renn means 'old queen'
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_19_Cynical_Default	Text	Everything's about old stuff around here, isn't it?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_20_Radulf_NPC	Text	Also, beware of gaks.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_21_Default_Default	Text	The what?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_22_Orcish_Default	Text	That means...skin...less?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_23_Violent_Default	Text	Skinless? Wait? Soraks? They're here, too?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_24_Selfpres_Default	Text	No surprise there. They're after the gems too, remember?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_25_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Can they impersonate orcs?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_26_Selfpres_Default	Text	Why not?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_27_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Anyway, I don't think we have much choice.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_28_Pragmatic_Default	Text	We'll get your holy axe.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_29_Radulf_NPC	Text	Praise be.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_30_Cynical_Default	Text	He sounds like Beric Sunblaze.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_31_Einar_Default	Text	Don't.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_32_Cynical_Default	Text	It was a compliment.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_1_Choice1_WRITTEN	Text	Who's the old queen?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_2_Choice2_WRITTEN	Text	What's the holy axe?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_3_Choice3_WRITTEN	Text	Let's go.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_4_Choice1_Default	Text	So, who's this old queen?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_5_Kebra_NPC	Text	Monster. Strong. Hates light.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_6_Selfpres_Default	Text	What kind of monster?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_7_Kebra_NPC	Text	Do not know. Plenty go after holy axe, no one comes back to tell.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_8_Selfpres_Default	Text	Encouraging...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_9_Selfpres_Default	Text	About this so-called holy axe...what is it?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_10_Kebra_NPC	Text	Holy axe was of ancestor of orcs, legend says, brought from the Endless Range.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_11_ChoiceA_WRITTEN	Text	Ancestors?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_12_ChoiceB_WRITTEN	Text	Endless Range?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_13_ChoiceC_WRITTEN	Text	Forget it.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_14_ChoiceA_Default	Text	Orcs have ancestors?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_15_Any_Default	Text	Orcs born out from Great Collapse, from its magic.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_16_Any_Default	Text	Ancestors were great warriors from the Endless Range.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_17_ChoiceB_Default	Text	What's the Endless Range?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_18_History_Default	Text	A name for the plains of Tirmar.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_19_Default_Default	Text	Orcs were Tirmarian?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_20_History_Default	Text	No.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_21_Any_Default	Text	We don't have time for historical debates.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_22_ChoiceC_Default	Text	We know enough.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_23_Choice3_Default	Text	Let's find this old queen, then.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_1_Default_NPC	Text	Webs?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_2_Selfpres_NPC	Text	Oh, no? That's what the old queen is? Another spider?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_3_Violent_Default	Text	We can deal with a spider.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_4_Default_Default	Text	Even two.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_5_Violent_Default	Text	But a very, very big deep spider.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_6_Selfpres_Default	Text	Come on! How big can it be?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_7_Cynical_NPC	Text	We should bring its head back to the Council. Faisech will love it.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_1_Pragmatic_Default	Text	What happened?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_2_Arcana_Default	Text	It's magical darkness.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_3_Selfpres_Default	Text	We need light! It's an extra-super big deep spider!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_4_Default_Default	Text	And it has anti-light magic?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_5_Selfpres_Default	Text	This is insane! Let's go back!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_6_Selfpres_Default	Text	I'd rather kill all the orcs in that damned volcano than walk down this spider pit in the pitch dark.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_7_Pragmatic_Default	Text	There has to be a way.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_1_Cynical_Default	Text	I promise, I'll never scoff again at 'anything is possible in the Badlands'.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_2_Pragmatic_Default	Text	At least we got it.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_3_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Hopefully that means another orc tribe behind us.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_4_Greed_Default	Text	You really want to give up this axe?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_5_Greed_Default	Text	Look at it? it's a masterpiece!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_6_Nosy_Default	Text	Tirmarian smiths were just as good as the elves of Manacalon!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_7_Nosy_Default	Text	This axe is fantastic!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_8_Greed_Default	Text	I say we keep it.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_9_Authority_Default	Text	The gem's more important - and to get that, we need to give the axe to Bladefang.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_1_Radulf_NPC	Text	Brok is back with nyarks?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_2_Radulf_NPC	Text	Have the...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_3_WRITTEN_Pragmatic	Text	Here, your axe.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_4_WRITTEN_Greed	Text	We'll keep it.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_5_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Here it is, your holy axe.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_6_Radulf_NPC	Text	I knew it was real!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_7_Radulf_NPC	Text	It is magnificient.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_8_Cynical_Default	Text	Nice vocabulary.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_9_Radulf_NPC	Text	You made Bladefang more powerful than ever!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_10_Radulf_NPC	Text	We follow you against Arrok!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_11_Greed_Default	Text	It was too hard to get it, it's ours, now.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_12_Radulf_NPC	Text	But axe is orc inheritance.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_13_Greed_Default	Text	It's Tirmarian, not orc.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_14_Radulf_NPC	Text	Pah! Should know better than trust nyarks!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_15_Radulf_NPC	Text	Leave Bladefang. Now.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_1_Default_Default	Text	Look at that! Another library!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_2_Default2_Default	Text	It looks very like the tower where we found the Crown.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_3_History_Default	Text	But it's makeshift, not Manacalon.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_4_Kebra_NPC	Text	Home of Sandraven, and shaman Urka.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_5_Nosy_WRITTEN	Text	Why the Manacalon style?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_6_Pragmatic_WRITTEN	Text	Tell us about Sandraven tribe.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_7_Authority_WRITTEN	Text	Let's go.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_8_Nosy_Default	Text	Why is this place made of Manacalon remnants?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_9_Kebra_NPC	Text	Urka very wise shaman.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_10_Kebra_NPC	Text	Reads books.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_11_Nosy_Default	Text	Orcs can read?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_12_Cynical_Default	Text	Amaaazing.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_13_Pragmatic_Default	Text	What should we know about Sandraven?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_14_Kebra_NPC	Text	Urka loves old elf stuff.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_15_Kebra_NPC	Text	Ask you to bring back some, for sure.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_16_Kebra_NPC	Text	But his tribe can fight, useful for facing Arrok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_17_Authority_Default	Text	Let's do this. I think they've seen us, anyway.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_18_Urka_NPC	Text	Kebra?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_19_Urka_NPC	Text	I thought you were dead.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_20_Urka_NPC	Text	Who are your nyark... friends?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_21_Kebra_NPC	Text	They help me and Brok. We gather all tribes against Arrok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_22_Urka_NPC	Text	Oh, Arrok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_23_Authority_Default	Text	Urka, eh?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_24_Urka_NPC	Text	Yes.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_25_Authority_Default	Text	We need your tribe to support Brok's challenge against Arrok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_26_Urka_NPC	Text	Hmmm. First, bring me the key to the sunken city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_27_Authority_Default	Text	What's that?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_28_Urka_NPC	Text	Down in the Cradle of Fire is a Manacalon city called Sentharyllian.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_29_Urka_NPC	Text	It melted into the mountain, since the Great Collapse.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_30_Urka_NPC	Text	But Arrok... he found it first.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_31_Urka_NPC	Text	Found his stone of power there.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_32_Urka_NPC	Text	Now, no one can enter, unless...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_33_Urka_NPC	Text	...unless you go through the necropolis.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_34_Urka_NPC	Text	Find the Emperor's key.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_35_Urka_NPC	Text	Bring it back to me, and my tribe will support Suncloud.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_36_Choice1_WRITTEN	Text	It's a deal!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_37_Choice2_WRITTEN	Text	Arrok is already in the city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_38_Choice3_WRITTEN	Text	The Emperor's key?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_39_Choice4_WRITTEN	Text	It must be very dangerous.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_40_Choice4_Default	Text	If Arrok the powerful didn't go there, it must be awfully dangerous.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_41_Urka_NPC	Text	Not more than facing Arrok without help.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_42_Choice3_Default	Text	What is this key?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_43_Urka_NPC	Text	It is said that the Emperor was buried with a magical key that opens the city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_44_Urka_NPC	Text	So find his tomb and bring me the key.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_45_Choice2_Default	Text	Why do you want that key if Arrok is already inside the city?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_46_Urka_NPC	Text	Arrok only found a part of the city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_47_Urka_NPC	Text	The key will open many more rooms... to me.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_48_Choice1_Default	Text	All right, we'll bring you the key.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Entrance_1_Default_Default	Text	I think that's the necropolis.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Entrance_2_Selfpres_Default	Text	Orcs don't go there? I really can't see why.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Entrance_3_Authority_Default	Text	Let's go find this key.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Hall_1_Default_Default	Text	That's a change of mood.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Hall_2_Nosy_Default	Text	Fantastic! It's like travelling back in time, a thousand years!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Hall_3_Selfpres_Default	Text	Well, it still stinks of sulfur.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_1_Default_Default	Text	So far, this looks more like a museum than a crypt.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_2_History_Default	Text	Manacalon custom. The tombs of the powerful have a hall of honor before the burial chamber.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_3_Greed_Default	Text	It's a map of the Manacalon Empire! It must be a thousand years old - maybe more!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_4_Cynical_Default	Text	So, they really did rule the world.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_5_Greed_Default	Text	This is invaluable. I should compare it to our own map.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_6_History_Default	Text	Here - this is Hickory Corner Wood! I've been there, and there's nothing but an old statue. The map shows an outpost!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_7_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Maybe it's buried, like this city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_8_Authority_Default	Text	Let's put that on our map - maybe someday we can go check it out.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_1_History_Default	Text	We have our answer - this isn't just any tomb.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_2_Cynical_Default	Text	Yeah, it's a damned Imperial slaver's tomb.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_3_Lawful_Default	Text	We know...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_4_History_Default	Text	This one was Laethar Aerlinn, first of his name.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_5_Pragmatic_Default	Text	In the middle of the Badlands, and not in the capital city? That's weird.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_6_History_Default	Text	It might have been displaced during the Cataclysm, and sunk down here. 
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_7_Lawful_Default	Text	I would have expected something bigger, fancier.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_8_Cynical_Default	Text	Maybe he was a modest Emperor - if such a thing's possible.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_9_Authority_Default	Text	We still need to find an entrance to the city. Let's go!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_1_History_Default	Text	Prince Kealin, firstborn.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_2_Violent_Default	Text	His son? Never got to be Emperor - died too soon.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_3_Cynical_Default	Text	Murdered, most likely. Happy families, and all that.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_4_Authority_Default	Text	Let's go.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_1_History_Default	Text	Queen Saefinala, dearest wife and mother.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_2_Cynical_Default	Text	Cute.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_3_Lawful_Default	Text	Show some respect.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_4_Carver_Default	Text	Slavers, the whole lot of them.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_1_Ghost_NPC	Text	Who dares disturb the eternal rest of the Emperor Laethar?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_2_Default_WRITTENONLY	Text	We mean no disrespect.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_3_Deception_WRITTENONLY	Text	We got lost.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_4_Persuasion_WRITTENONLY	Text	We're clearing your city of orcs.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_5_Intimidation_WRITTENONLY	Text	We go where we like.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_6_Intimidation_Answer01	Text	This isn't your world any more - we can go wherever we like!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_7_Ghost_NPC	Text	Fool!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_8_Ghost_NPC	Text	Your souls will never leave this tomb!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_9_Persuasion_Answer02	Text	You city is infested by orcs. We're here to clean it up.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_10_Ghost_NPC	Text	What are orcs?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_11_Cynical_Default	Text	Smart move!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_12_Persuasion_Default	Text	Evil monsters. They're desecrating your city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_13_Deception_Answer03	Text	We just got lost, sorry.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_14_Ghost_NPC	Text	Lies of a tomb robber!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_15_Default_Answer04	Text	We mean no disrespect.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_16_Ghost_NPC	Text	Then what do you mean?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_17_Ghost_NPC	Text	Monsters, you say? 
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_18_Ghost_NPC	Text	Clearly you are runaway slaves. You will be punished!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_19_Violent_Slang	Text	I've had enough of this. Let's kill this loser - again!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_20_Violent_Normal	Text	Enough of this! Let's wipe this slaver's ghost from Solasta!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_21_Persuasion_Default	Text	We call them orcs, they're like... dwarves, but worse.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_22_Ghost_NPC	Text	Really?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_23_Ghost_NPC	Text	Then you are on a sacred mission.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_24_Ghost_NPC	Text	Monsters must not defile a city of Emperors.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_25_Ghost_NPC	Text	Leave this holy tomb and do what you must.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_26_Ghost_NPC	Text	There is minor gate by the tapestry of the Aer-Elai. Use it to reach the inner city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_27_Persuasion_Default	Text	Thank you, your Imperial Majesty.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_1_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Did you see that?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_2_Cynical_Default	Text	The ghost? Yes, we did.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_3_Pragmatic_Default	Text	The key! It's in the coffin.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_4_Selfpres_Default	Text	Oh, no!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_5_Pragmatic_Default	Text	So what do we do?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_6_Cynical_Default	Text	Wake him up again and ask nicely?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_7_Violent_Default	Text	Get ready for a fight.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_8_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Why don't we just go into the city and kill Arrok?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_9_Selfpres_Default	Text	Which is worse? Fighting Arrok by ourselves, or this dead Emperor?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_1_Ghost_NPC	Text	You again?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_2_Cynical_Normal	Text	Sorry, your Imperialness. We just need that pretty key of yours.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_3_Cynical_Formal	Text	Our apologies, Emperor, but your time has long gone.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_4_Cynical_Slang	Text	Time to die for good, dead boy!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_5_Ghost_NPC	Text	Liars! Traitors!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_1_Authority_Default	Text	Urka!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_2_Urka_NPC	Text	I must say, I am impressed.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_3_Selfpres_Default	Text	You followed us?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_4_Urka_NPC	Text	So you don't have bring the key back to me.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_5_Selfpres_Default	Text	You really want that key, don't you?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_6_Urka_NPC	Text	Actually, I wanted the ghost to weaken you.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_7_Urka_NPC	Text	Make it easier to take that crown from you.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_1_Kebra_NPC	Text	Urka? How? I know him since...child.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_2_Lawful_Default	Text	The Soraks - the gaks - they got to him, I guess.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_3_Kebra_NPC	Text	But, all these orcs, too?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_4_History_Default	Text	The Soraks took over a whole world, back on Tirmar.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_5_Kebra_NPC	Text	The Crown? It can stop them?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_6_Authority_Default	Text	We think so - hope so.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_7_Kebra_NPC	Text	You need Arrok's stone, for real.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_1_Brok_NPC	Text	Nyark friends. You convince the tribes?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_2_Authority_Default	Text	Bad news. Urka was corrupted by the gaks.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_3_Brok_NPC	Text	Urka? Big mind like him?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_4_Kebra_NPC	Text	I saw him. Like crazy. The gaks can do this.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_5_Brok_NPC	Text	Maybe Arrok is gak, too?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_6_Authority_Default	Text	Doesn't matter now, we need to take the fight to him.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_7_Brok_NPC	Text	But Sandraven?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_8_Kebra_NPC	Text	You choose a chief for them, and they follow you.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_9_Default_Default	Text	Also, Radulf will not come.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_10_Default_Default	Text	We couldn't reach an agreement.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_11_Brok_NPC	Text	Hm. Meet us near Redscar gate.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_12_Default_Player	Text	What is that?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_13_Brok_NPC	Text	Redscar gate. Arrok's fortress.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_14_Violence_Player	Text	Can't we just kill the guards and go in?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_15_Brok_NPC	Text	Door is magic. 
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_16_Brok_NPC	Text	But Arrok will open, if challenged.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_17_Brok_NPC	Text	We need the tribes.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_1_History_NPC	Text	Can't get used to these Minor Gates. To think they had these everywhere!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_2_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Now's not the time for Manacalon nostalgia.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_3_Kebra_NPC	Text	Look!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_4_Authority_Default	Text	Is that...?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_5_Kebra_NPC	Text	Arrok! Alone!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_6_Cynical_Default	Text	That did the trick, eh?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_7_Selfpres_Default	Text	What are these burned corpses everywhere?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_8_Kebra_NPC	Text	Orcs. Didn't please Arrok, I suppose.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_9_Cynical_Default	Text	Well, looks like he did half the job for us.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_10_Authority_NPC	Text	Do we need the tribes, now?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_11_Violent_NPC	Text	I reckon we can take him - we have the advantage of surprise.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_12_Kebra_NPC	Text	Arrok still very powerful.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_13_Violent_NPC	Text	Sure. So we need to take him down fast.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_14_Selfpres_NPC	Text	We can still backtrack and follow the plan.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_1_Cynical_Default	Text	Uh huh.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_2_Arrok_NPC	Text	Ah, Kebra of Suncloud...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_3_Arrok_NPC	Text	...you walk with nyarks? Shame on you.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_4_Authority_Default	Text	You're finished, Arrok. Give us the stone!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_5_Arrok_NPC	Text	Funny nyark. No, you, give me yours.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_6_Authority_Default	Text	You're alone. Looks like you killed your tribe all by yourself.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_7_Arrok_NPC	Text	Useless worms.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_8_Arrok_NPC	Text	Arrok needs no orcs. Arrok is fire! Arrok is volcano!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_9_Selfpres_Default	Text	What the...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_1_Authority_Default	Text	Brok!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_2_Authority_Default	Text	Where are the guards?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_3_Brok_NPC	Text	Surrendered.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_4_Default_Default	Text	What?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_5_Brok_NPC	Text	So afraid of Arrok, they joined us already.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_6_Cynical_Default	Text	No big speech, then?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_7_Brok_NPC	Text	No, but door still closed.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_8_Crownbearer_Default	Text	Do you see that?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_9_Cynical_Default	Text	The door?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_10_Crownbearer_Default	Text	No, there is a... power.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_11_Crownbearer_Default	Text	I think, though... with the Crown...we might be able to enter.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_12_Selfpres_Default	Text	It's a trap. Arrok wants us in there alone.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_13_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Do we have a choice?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_14_Default_Default	Text	There's always the necropolis.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_1_Nosy_Default	Text	Is that gem more powerful than the others?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_2_Arcane_Default	Text	Orc shamans wield a very peculiar type of magic...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_3_Arcane_Default	Text	...the gem must have been some sort of catalyst.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_4_Pragmatic_Default	Text	Well, we have it now. Let's move before this place blows up!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_1_Selfpres_Default	Text	That was close!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_2_Friendly_Default	Text	What do you think happened to...
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_3_Friendly_NPC	Text	...our orc friends?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_4_Selfish_Default	Text	You mean yours. They're no friends of mine.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_5_Violent_Default	Text	Burned dead... who cares?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_6_Friendly_Default	Text	They seem more civilized than I expected.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_7_Violent_Default	Text	Next time we run into some, you can tell them that.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_8_Authority_Default	Text	All right  let's get out of here. It's not safe!
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_1_Crownbearer_Default	Text	This is it, I think! It's just behind this wall of vegetation!
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_2_CynicOrElse_Default	Text	You think? That's comforting. And how do we get through? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_3_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default	Text	Just hack and slash, rinse and repeat, until we're through! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_4a_CynicOrElse_Default	Text	I've heard that before…
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_4b_CynicOrElse_Default	Text	…a couple of hundred times since we started…
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_4c_HighestCharismaIfNotCynicOrnotCynic_Default	Text	Oh, come on! Less bitching and more hacking!
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_5_LowestSTRorElse_Default	Text	I so love manual labor! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_6_FollowerMaraikeOrElse_Default	Text	It's Maraike's will!
Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_1_CynicOrElse_Default	Text	I think my arm's about to drop off from all this hacking!
Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_2_SellswordorElse_Slang	Text	Chop, don't talk!
Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_3_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default	Text	Come on, guys! It's just another hedge! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_4_LowestSTRorElse_Default	Text	Last bloody hedge I intend to cut through in my life time! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_5_RogueOrFollowerMaraikeOrElse_Default	Text	Misaye's laughing!
Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_1_LowestSTRorElse_Default	Text	Such a wonderful coincidence to get a sauna after all the physical exertion!
Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_2_SellswordorElse_Slang	Text	Stop moaning - it was just a nice warm-up!
Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_3_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default	Text	I have dealt with worse! Not often, though!
Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_4_CynicOrElse_Default	Text	Hard to believe! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_5_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default	Text	Einar strike me if I lie!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_1_SpyOrElse_Default	Text	Now, my friend - it's time for a little chat.
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_2_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	Text	I'll give you nothing! Sorr-Tarr will protect me from your torture!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_3_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	Text	He isn't here, Two-Face - but Iam!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_4_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	Text	This place will be your death, too! It is cursed! Its magic is twisted!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_5a_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	Text	This place? How did you get here? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_5a_Written_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	Text	How did you come to this place? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_6a_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	Text	We were sent by our chosen one! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_7a_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	Text	An acolyte of Sorr-Tarr…
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_6a1_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	Text	Blessed be his name.
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_7a1_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	Text	How did he locate the place? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_7a2_Intimidation_DC20_Default	Text	Ever heard of the Inquisition ? Talk to us now!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_8a1_Sorak_Prisoner_Intimidation_Success_NPC	Text	The chosen one worked some magic. 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_8a2_Sorak_Prisoner_Intimidation_Failure_NPC	Text	The Inquisition? Pah! Nothing you can do to me can beat the horrors of this place!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_5b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	Text	This place is cursed? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_5b_written_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	Text	What curse? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_6b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	Text	Don't you have eyes? Didn't you see the fate of my brethren?
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_7b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	Text	Won't lose sleep over it! What is cursed? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_8b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	Text	This very place! Everything seemed peaceful, and then...
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_9b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	Text	Who said what? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_10b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	Text	The voice! It said we would all die!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_11b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	Text	Because I know we will all die here! It said so! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_12_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	Text	Disturbing claims! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_13_SpyOrCautious_Default	Text	Sure, all these dead Soraks, and no trace of what killed them…
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_14_SpyOrCautious_Default	Text	…but we saw dead Soraks everywhere…
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_15_SpyOrCautious_Default	Text	... and not one single enemy body near them! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_16_Lawkeeper_Default	Text	They could have taken their dead, just like the Soraks do.
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_17_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	Text	And what do we do with our friend here? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_18_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	Text	He is a Sorak pawn - there is only one thing to do! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_19_LawkeeperOrElse_Default	Text	And yet, we have laws! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_20_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	Text	He's too dangerous! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_21_LawkeeperOrElse_Default	Text	Who are we, to call ourselves judges and executioners?
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_22_AnyPriestOrPaladin_Default	Text	Servants of the gods!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_23_AnyNonHuman_Default	Text	Protectors of Solasta!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default	Text	Those statues look weird!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_2_Sellsword_Slang	Text	Perhaps - but those chests look mighty real to me!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_3_LawkeeperOrElse_Default	Text	But are we entitled to it? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_4_Sellsword_Slang	Text	What do you mean? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_5_LawkeeperOrElse_Default	Text	So far, we haven't met a living soul in this labyrinth!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_6_CynicOrElse_Default	Text	And your point?
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_7_LawkeeperOrElse_Default	Text	That we would be stealing from the owner!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_8_SellswordOrGreed_Default	Text	Naah - spoils of war!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_9_LawkeeperOrElse_Default	Text	But we want his help, remember - stealing makes a bad impression, usually.
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_10_SellswordOrGreed_Default	Text	Can we just take a peek first. We don't have to take anything. 
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_11_SellswordOrGreed_Default	Text	Oooops… Sorry? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_12_LawkeeperOrElse_Default	Text	All right, but don't make me regret it! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_1_Beast_NPC	Text	And so the thieves come to meet their doom!
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_2_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal	Text	There are no thieves here! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_3_Beast_NPC	Text	Do you deny helping yourselves to the riches outside this room?
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_4_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal	Text	We were looking for clues and then we were attacked…
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_5_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Default	Text	…by some constructs that really, really wanted to kill us!
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_6_Beast_NPC	Text	Hah! The constructs wouldn't have attacked…
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_7_Beast_NPC	Text	... if you had just looked! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_8a_SellswordOrGreed_Default	Text	Had to make sure they weren't fake!
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_8b_LawkeeperOrAltruist_Default	Text	We didn't even have a chance to put them back! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_9_Beast_NPC	Text	You stole! Otherwise there would have been no fight! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_10_Beast_NPC	Text	And there is only one punishment for theft!
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_11_Beast_NPC	Text	Death!
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_1_SellswordOrGreed_Slang	Text	This is my kind of fight!
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_2_Crownbearer_Default	Text	Well, I can relate to that, but I also wonder... 
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_3_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Default	Text	Wonder about what?
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_4_Crownbearer_Default	Text	Why all of this? Why the traps, why the fights?
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_5_NosyOElse_Default	Text	Not to forget the how! 
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_6_Crownbearer_Default	Text	This gem fragment… resonates with the Crown but…
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_7_NosyOElse_Default	Text	Apparently the gem was split… to protect it, maybe? 
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_8_Crownbearer_Default	Text	That would explain the traps and monsters.
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_9_NosyOElse_Default	Text	It's one way to make sure this gem is safe! 
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_10_Self_PreservationOrElse_Default	Text	But what does it mean?
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_10_NosyOElse_Default	Text	That another Master survived the Cataclysm.
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_11_Cynic_Default	Text	Someone who doesn't like visitors. 
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal	Text	What was that? Where are we? 
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_2_SelfPreservationOrSelfishness_Normal	Text	You had to step on it! 
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_3_SelfPreservationOrSelfishness_Normal	Text	Find us a way back! 
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_4_NosyOrElse_Formal	Text	My friend, we will have to think this through!
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_5_CynicOrElse_Normal	Text	And watch where you put your hands in the future.
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_6_SellswordOrGreed_Normal	Text	How was I supposed to know? 
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_7_NosyOrElse_Normal	Text	Perhaps if you thought before you acted?
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_8_SellswordOrGreed_Normal	Text	So I can die of old age and boredom…
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_9_SellswordOrGreed_Normal	Text	…while we wait for you to finish pondering all the...
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_10_SellswordOrGreed_Formal	Text	...theoretical and practical implications of everything we do?
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_11_NosyOrElse_Normal	Text	Nothing wrong with using one's brain, my musclebound friend!
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_12_CrownbearerOrAuthority_Normal	Text	Enough! Let's find a way out of this trap…

Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal	Text	I just felt something!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_2_NosyOrElse_Normal	Text	Like what?

Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_4_Butler_NPC	Text	To the master, of course! 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_5_Crownbearer_Normal	Text	And who would that be?

Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_7_Butler_NPC	Text	I am at your disposal. Please enjoy our hospitality - but…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_8_Butler_NPC	Text	…please don't abuse it.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9a_DiplomatOrElse_Formal	Text	We are grateful for your hospitality.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9a_written_DiplomatOrElse_Formal	Text	Hospitality? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_10a_Butler_NPC	Text	We aim to please. The household has certain standards, after all.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_11a_Butler_NPC	Text	We have not seen guests of your... quality for some time.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_12a_DiplomatOrElse_Formal	Text	Some time? How long, exactly? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_13a_Butler_NPC	Text	Well, it must be… forgive me, the date eludes me for the moment.

Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_10b_Butler_NPC	Text	Yes, believe it or not, some…creatures can be…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_11b_Butler_NPC	Text	...insufferably rude!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_12b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal	Text	True nobility is reflected in the character!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_13h_Butler_NPC	Text	Quite so! Not, of course, that I thought for a second…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_14b_Butler_NPC	Text	...that you would be capable of such discourtesy.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_15b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal	Text	Of course not! And yet, customs being different everywhere…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_16b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal	Text	…might I ask what would be considered rude here? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_17b_Butler_NPC	Text	Well, my expectations don't exceed those of the Imperial court!

Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_19b_Butler_NPC	Text	Preferably not. Not that it would be the first time…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_20b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal	Text	Really? 
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_21b_Butler_NPC	Text	I have seen worse, I'm sorry to say!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_22b_Butler_NPC	Text	But now, please follow me. One mustn't keep the master waiting! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_1_Master_NPC	Text	Well met strangers!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_2_Master_IfplayersStole_NPC	Text	Ah, my little thieving visitors.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_3_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal	Text	Clear skies to you, master.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_4_Master_NPC	Text	Clear skies? An ironic greeting, considering my plight! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_5_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal	Text	Your plight? 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_6_Master_NPC	Text	That I haven't taken to the skies in a long time! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_7_Master_NPC	Text	It must have been a thousand years…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_8_Master_NPC	Text	I am… 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_9_Master_NPC	Text	How weird, I can't recall my name…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_10_Master_NPC	Text	Call me master.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_11_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal	Text	Master of Conjuration!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_12_Master_NPC	Text	Yes, the Master of Conjuration! Exactly! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_13_Crownbearer_Formal	Text	Greetings, old friend!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_14_AnyButCrownbearer_Normal	Text	What do you call him that?
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_15_Crownbearer_Normal	Text	The crown…told me so.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_16_Master_NPC	Text	Ah, the crown…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_17_Master_NPC	Text	…thank you for coming to my rescue, 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_18_Master_NPC	Text	My mind was shattered since the Cataclysm.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_19_Master_NPC	Text	The vanishing of mana left me broken.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_20_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal	Text	Mana was gone ? 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_21_Master_NPC	Text	Of course, after the closing of the rift!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_22_Master_NPC	Text	That's why I and by siblings were killed or crippled.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_23_Master_NPC	Text	Kaisenax, and us, the masters, along with these deities…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_24_Master_NPC	Text	…we poured everything we had to close and seal that rift! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_25_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal	Text	So the Cataclysm is…your fault? 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_26_Master_NPC	Text	It was the price to pay to stop the threat.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_27_Master_NPC	Text	The Sorr-Akkath were and still are a menace to Solasta.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_28_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal	Text	And so you took a gamble? 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_29_Master_NPC	Text	We were born to rule, not to grovel!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_30_Master_NPC	Text	And we had sworn to protect our people! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_31_AnyNonElf_Normal	Text	You mean your slaves?
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_32_Master_NPC	Text	Fool! Imperial rule brought order where there was only chaos!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_33_Master_NPC	Text	But your empire was destroyed.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_34_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal	Text	Who knows how many elves were killed?
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_35_Master_NPC	Text	Ah! Because you believe that Manacalon was an elven empire!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_36_Master_NPC	Text	Enough about the past! 
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_37_Master_NPC	Text	Now I get that you want my gem.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_38_Master_NPC	Text	But even with his crown, you're not my Magister!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_39_Master_NPC	Text	So if you want it…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_40_Master_NPC	Text	…you'll have to pry it from my dead claws!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_07	Text	Kill them!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_08	Text	Intruders!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_09	Text	Don't let them get away!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_10	Text	They're crazy!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_11	Text	They'll kill us if we don't fight back!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_12	Text	I stepped on some kind of magical rune. I guess there's a reason for that.
Narration/&Banter_ToM_13	Text	Found one!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_14	Text	Eh… nothing. Very funny.
Narration/&Banter_ToM_15	Text	Another one, here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego23_Spy_Default	Text	Alright, I'm opening it.
Narration/&Banter_SwitchToCautious	Text	We should be careful.
Narration/&PriestOfArun1_Priest_NPC	Text	Sun on your face, travelers!
Narration/&PriestOfArun2_Arun_Default	Text	Balance and harmony, chaplain!
Narration/&PriestOfArun3_Priest_NPC	Text	Fair weather, faithful one.
Narration/&PriestOfArun4_Priest_NPC	Text	Good luck and fair weather!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_16_DalonLark_NPC	Text	Did you find any relics of interest in our fight against the Sorr-Akkath?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_01	Text	Charming little town…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_02	Text	Access to the canyon is blocked!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_03	Text	You can't get to the other side - move on!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_04	Text	You are not allowed to cross this bridge.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_01	Text	Careful - I heard something!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_02	Text	What were these goblins doing here?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_03	Text	There must be some reason.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_04	Text	Look - it works!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_05	Text	It's something, isn't it?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_06	Text	This is where they're coming from.
Narration/&Atima_Bladeburn_Goodbye	Text	Just passing by.

Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_LiamArrives	Text	Liam! What are you doing here? I told you I'd take care of it!
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel9_Default	Text	Wait… Lisbath stayed back?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel10_Default	Text	She was broken.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel11_Default	Text	They're gonna kill her!
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel12_Default	Text	If we go back for her, we die, too.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel13_Default	Text	But… Fine… you're probably right.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_01	Text	There's something strange about this place.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_02	Text	I feel like someone's watching us.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_03	Text	Looks kinda familiar, don't you think?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_04	Text	It's too quiet!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_05	Text	This is huge!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_06	Text	Did you see that?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_07	Text	A Defiler. It vanished!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_08	Text	We should be careful. We're not alone.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Kythaela_01	Text	Master, I'm coming!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Loot_01	Text	I can see something in the water.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Loot_02	Text	There's something under the ground.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_01	Text	Friends are always welcome at the Shield!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_02	Text	Peasants probably lived in these outbuildings.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_03	Text	These walls seem to have been reinforced recently.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_04	Text	Lore text
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_05	Text	Lore Text
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_06	Text	That elf looks so military in that garb, and those symbols on the tabard! It can only be Empress Cylloriel Wildspirit!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_07	Text	Lore about the hall
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_PuzzleLight_01	Text	It doesn't do anything. Maybe we're missing something.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_PuzzleLight_02	Text	We've dealt with this before.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_PuzzleLight_03	Text	We should come back at the night.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_09	Text	A spectacular place, isn't it?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_10	Text	Are they… ghosts?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_11	Text	What other wonders does this place contain?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_12	Text	Let's stay on guard.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Kythaela_02	Text	We're close now, I can feel it.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_13_A	Text	This magic goes far beyond our knowledge.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_13_B	Text	We can't go through here. It's too dangerous.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_09	Text	Unbelievable, an intact copy of the History of the Elven Wars by the First Loremaster of the Arcaneum!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_10	Text	This harp - look at the grain of this wood, the patina… it hasn’t aged a day, seems anachronistic… And a 48-stringer!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_11	Text	Knowing Manacalon, it could be anything! And I bet we don’t have enough mana to make it work!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_07	Text	It looks like a pattern that needs to be reproduced in some way…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_08	Text	This is a poem in elvish… about the moonlight?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_09	Text	Maybe this only works at night!
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_19_Nope_Formal	Text	We'll see what we can do.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_18_Nope_WRITTEN	Text	We can't promise anything.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_18_Sure_WRITTEN	Text	Sure, we'll do it.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_13	Text	What is that?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_14	Text	Sorry for the inconvenience.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_12	Text	Laboratory. ENTRY STRICTLY PROHIBITED.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_13	Text	Library
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_14	Text	Salon
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Kythaela_03	Text	These projections are from the master, not ghosts.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_36_SellswordOrElse_Default	Text	It was too late for him.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_ PuzzleLight_Broken	Text	This symbol is illegible. Perhaps we can find another one elsewhere?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_15	Text	The… projections, they're all gone.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_16	Text	This must have something to do with Adrasteia's awakening.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_4_Healer_Any_Normal	Text	She doesn't have any wounds that I can see!

Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_LavaRiver_01	Text	Wait? Have you ever seen this kind of plant?
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_LavaRiver_02	Text	The gem must be in this forest. One last effort and it will be ours.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_LavaRiver_03	Text	I knew it, we shouldn’t have touched that sticky equipment.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Entrance_3_Arbal_NPC	Text	Who your nyark friends?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Entrance_4_Arbal_NPC	Text	Eh, nyark speaks! Kebra teach them?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Entrance_10_Arbal_NPC	Text	Before Arrok, Arbal would kill nyarks.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Entrance_13_Arbal_NPC	Text	Not nice, no.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Entrance_15_Orcishspeaker_Default	Text	Ah! Thank you, nyark - that make my day.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_LavaRiver_04	Text	It's too thick, we won't make it like this!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_01	Text	What was that? Where are we?
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Gate_00	Text	Go back to where you came from, you insignificant beings. You are not worthy to enter.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Gate_01	Text	I laugh at the emptiness of your actions.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Gate_02	Text	Play the wise, you fools. Go ahead.

Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheClearing_01	Text	The gem, we found it!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheClearing_02	Text	Where are the Soraks?
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Beast_Observable_1	Text	The gold just disappears in my hands!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_01	Text	Edrof says gate closed for now.

Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_04	Text	Kebra friend with nyarks?
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Radulf_01	Text	Bring back the greataxe and I will consider an alliance.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Radulf_02	Text	This sigil will unlock the door to my challenge.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Radulf_03	Text	No greataxe means we are not joining you.
Narration/&Tavern_02_41_Player_Default	Text	Go easy on him. He's just a harmless, old drunk.
Narration/&Tavern_02_42_Player_Default	Text	Probably saw lizardfolk, or dragonborn, or something…
Narration/&Tavern_02_43_Merton	Text	You think I don't know the difference?
Narration/&Tavern_02_44_Merton	Text	All those spines on their backs, those jaws - you've never seen anything like it!
Narration/&Tavern_02_45_Merton	Text	Not lizardfolk, not troglodyte, not dragonborn. I'm telling you!
Narration/&Tavern_02_46_Player_Default	Text	No one believes in Soraks anymore.
Narration/&Tavern_02_47_Player_Default	Text	Except the Church of Einar, of course - there's a Sorak under every bed if you believe them.
Narration/&Tavern_02_48_Player_Default	Text	Easy, now. Don't mock people for their faith.
Narration/&Tavern_02_49_Merton	Text	Read them books. Soraks are masters of deception, infiltration…
Narration/&Tavern_02_50_Merton	Text	…anyone here could be a Sorak, you'd never know.
Narration/&Tavern_02_51_Player_Default	Text	Oh, come on!
Narration/&Tavern_02_51_Merton	Text	You'll see.
Narration/&Tavern_02_52_Player_Default	Text	Anyway…
Narration/&Tavern_01_2b_Explorer_Default	Text	Is this the place for the Legacy Council job? Hope I'm not too late.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Choiceb	Text	The Council's very new. How does it work, exactly?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran01b	Text	Dear Maraike! You don't know?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Player01b	Text	Well, we know that each of the Eastern Kingdoms has a delegation…
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran02b	Text	No - not the kingdoms. The Council is a neutral, academic body - in theory, at least.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran03b	Text	It's true, though, that each delegation is from a different nation.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran04b	Text	Except for the Church of Einar. They are here to ensure fair dealings.
Narration/&Council01_70b_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze	Text	Our church has been warning of the Sorr-Akkath since humans first came to Solasta…
Narration/&Council01_71b_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze	Text	…in the wake of their foul god Sorr-Tarr!
Narration/&Council03_37b_Einarboss_NPC	Text	Their foul god Sorr-Tarr knows. He is guiding them.
Narration/&Council03_37c_Einarboss_NPC	Text	We tried to leave him - and them - behind on Tirmar. It seems we failed.
Narration/&Council03_41b_Antiquariansboss_NPC	Text	Conjecture perhaps, but the evidence points in that direction.
Narration/&Council03_42b_Einarboss_NPC	Text	Now they want the Crown. We may not know why, but we do know they must not have it!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_01	Text	Yes… I understand.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_02	Text	Who are you talking to? Wait - what are you doing?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_03	Text	Are you crazy? Why did you put it on?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_04	Text	We have no idea what it does, whether it's evil, or anything!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_05	Text	What? I… Oh. I… It… I just… kind of… had to.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_06	Text	It's gotta be cursed! 
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_07	Text	We're supposed to share the loot, by the way.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_08	Text	Forget it, let's get out of here.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_39b_Fighter_Default	Text	Are they all undead in there?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_41_Default	Text	Undead? What other abominations are in there?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_42_Default	Text	Undead? What types? Are they free or enslaved?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_43_Default	Text	Undead? That's not good. And you deal with them?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_44_Default	Text	Undead. I might have known. Anything goes out here, it seems.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_06b_Intimidate_Default	Text	There's nowhere in the world where necromancy isn't a crime. 
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_37b_Player	Text	A defiler? A blood-drinking Child of Sorrow?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_37c_Player	Text	Twice-cursed defilers! They are the worst of the undead!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_44_Player	Text	Stay in the light! It is our only protection.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_45_Player	Text	Maraike will protect us. Her powers are strong against these abominations.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_11b_Kill_Default	Text	Abomination! The light of Einar will destroy you!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_11c_Kill_Default	Text	Twice-cursed monster! Prepare to die - again!
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel4b_Cynicism_Default	Text	Right out of a fairytale, as ugly as life.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel4c_Cynicism_Default	Text	And certainly not lizardfolk.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik21b_Player	Text	So - big, walking lizards with spikes all over their backs?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik21c_Player	Text	Except for the one who looked just like your Captain, of course.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik21d_Player	Text	Was he one of them all along, do you think?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_4b_History_Default	Text	Doesn't have the big spines…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_10_Default	Text	It's standing just like a human. Ever seen a dragon do that?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_11_Default	Text	Ever seen a dragon at all? How would you know?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_12_Default	Text	Stop losing time, it's just a statue.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_01	Text	Look at this place! I've never seen so many books!
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_02	Text	It would take a lifetime to read them all! Even for an elf!
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_03	Text	Must be worth a fortune! If only we could get everything back to Caer Cyflen…
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_04	Text	I see the point of the Scavengers now…
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_05	Text	Why not keep this to ourselves?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_01	Text	Crap! The book just turned into dust!
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_02	Text	Damn! This book is… not really here!
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_03	Text	Do you mean all this fortune is out of reach?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_04	Text	The library is trapped within this… magical phenomenon.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_05	Text	I should have known… it was too good to be true.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_22_Religion_Default	Text	That's an old Tirmarian symbol. It stands for Arivad.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_23_Religion_Default	Text	He was a Tirmarian god, but he didn't come to Solasta.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_24_Religion_Default	Text	I can't remember much more.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_25_Einar_Default	Text	"A" stands for Arivad - an evil god from old Tirmar. I read about him.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_26_Einar_Default	Text	The Soraks call him Sorr-Tarr. "Sorr-Akkath" means "beloved of Sorr-Tarr" in their tongue.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_27_Lowlife_Default	Text	I've heard whispers of cultists with an "A" tattoo.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_28_Lowlife_Default	Text	There's a name, too: "Arivad."
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_29_Default	Text	These humans are Arivad cultists, in league with the Soraks.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_30_Default	Text	We better be careful.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_31_Default	Text	And don't forget, we need the head of a Sorak.
Narration/&InTemple_1_Crowbearer_Default	Text	Lord Sunblaze - thank you for you hospitality.
Narration/&InTemple_2_EinarBoss_NPC	Text	It's the least we can do for the deputies who proved that there are still Soraks on Solasta.
Narration/&InTemple_3_EinarBoss_NPC	Text	You've proved we cannot relax our vigilance.
Narration/&InTemple_4_EinarBoss_NPC	Text	Did you find anything else that could help us track them?
Narration/&InTemple_5_EinarBoss_NPC	Text	There was a parchment. 
Narration/&InTemple_6_EinarBoss_NPC	Text	If you find it, send for the Tshar.
Narration/&InTemple_7_Curious_NPC	Text	You can read that?
Narration/&InTemple_8_EinarBoss_NPC	Text	That last word, it's not Tirmarian… it's in the Sorr-Akkath tongue.
Narration/&InTemple_9_Selfpres_NPC	Text	I knew it!
Narration/&InTemple_10_EinarBoss_NPC	Text	It means "general."
Narration/&InTemple_11_EinarBoss_NPC	Text	You were wise to run.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_1_Player_Default	Text	Also, the fanatics we fought near that old tower…
Narration/&InTemple_Added_2_Player_Default	Text	…they all had this tattoo on their arm.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_3_Player_Default	Text	And we found this letter.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_4_Player_Default	Text	It seems to support the idea that they were working for the Soraks under duress.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_5_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	It is indeed one of their ways. 
Narration/&InTemple_Added_6_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	Now this, is the A of Arivad.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_7_Player_Default	Text	Can you enlighten us?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_8_Player_Default	Text	Between the myth and what we've seen, it's confusing.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_9_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	Of course.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_10_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	We, paladins and clerics of Einar, are the guardians of these memories.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_11_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	Our ancestors fought the war against the Sorr-Akkath.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_12_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	Their god, Sorr-Tarr, gave them dark powers of treachery, mind reading, and shapechanging.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_13_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	They infiltrated the human society, corrupted the hearts of men.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_14_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	At some point, everyone was suspected to be a Sorak in disguise.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_15_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	Distrust broke humanity. Sorr-Tarr had won. 
Narration/&InTemple_Added_16_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	He corrupted even Arivad, god of the inquisitors.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_17_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	The gods themselves decided to run away from Tirmar.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_18_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	They opened the rift for the humans to escape, to Solasta.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_19_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	Many of them didn't make it. It was a tragedy.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_20_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	At the site of the rift, thousands of Sorak tried to cross.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_21_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	Sorr-Tarr himself tried.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_22_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	The rift was closed, in a gigantic blast.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_23_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	Our kings and heroes, Manacalon's masters of magic, were all wiped out.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_24_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	So, how could Soraks have survived, escaped and then thrived on Solasta?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_25_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	I supposed that's another one of their tricks.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_26_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	But for those who had survived the war, the exodus…
Narration/&InTemple_Added_27_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	…it was paramount to stay vigilant, to keep the memory alive.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_28_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	The memory of what Soraks were, what they could do.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_29_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	So that, if one day, they were to return.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_30_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	We'd be ready.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_31_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	I'm sorry to say, after a thousands years, only few of us remain.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_32_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	Most people believe Soraks are a mere legend, now.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_33_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	But you brought us proof.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_34_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	The Soraks are not extinct.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_35_NO_AUDIO	Text	Are there different Soraks?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_36_Player_Default	Text	We fought different ones, do you know more?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_37_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	The bulk of their army are foot soldiers, with poisoned spines.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_38_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	They breed a cast of albino priests, able to cast spells.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_39_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	Some of their are deadly assassins, invisible, venomous.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_40_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	Others are giant brutes.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_41_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	The scriptures talk of elite warriors, anti-paladins.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_42_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	The Shikkath.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_43_NO_AUDIO	Text	Can they mimic people?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_44_Player_Default	Text	Can they really impersonate people?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_45_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	It's been proven, though it's a long process.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_46_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	They used to kidnap a target, study it for weeks, sometimes months.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_47_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	One of their chosen ones would transform into a perfect duplicate.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_48_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	Upon death, they would return to their original form.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_49_NO_AUDIO	Text	Why do people follow them?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_50_Player_Default	Text	How do they get people to worship them?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_51_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	They get into people's minds…
Narration/&InTemple_Added_52_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	…learn their darkest secrets, they fears, their shameful desires.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_53_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	With that, they can blackmail, corrupt, and finally recruit.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_54_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC	Text	It's much easier for them than to duplicate, and very efficient.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_55_Player_Default	Text	Well, that's all very scary, but thanks, it's going to help us.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_56_Player_Default	Text	You're welcome, deputies.
Narration/&InTemple_12_EinarBoss_NPC	Text	If you find anything else connected to the Sorr-Akkath or their allies, bring it to the Temple.
Narration/&InTemple_13_EinarBoss_NPC	Text	Talk to Chaplain Dalon Lark. You will be well rewarded.
Narration/&InTemple_14_EinarBoss_NPC	Text	Whenever you're ready, the Council will meet again.
Narration/&Council02_Final1_Gormdsottir_NPC	Text	Deputies!
Narration/&Council02_Final2_Gormdsottir_NPC	Text	Your report speaks of a library in a tower of magic?
Narration/&Council02_Final3_Any_Default	Text	Yes, madam.
Narration/&Council02_Final4_Gormdsottir_NPC	Text	That is incredible! Do you realize the historical value?
Narration/&Council02_Final5_Any_Default	Text	Well, all these books are either floating above a chasm or… disappear on touch.
Narration/&Council02_Final6_Gormdsottir_NPC	Text	What? So all this knowledge is not accessible?
Narration/&Council02_Final7_Any_Default	Text	It's going to take a lot of time to check the place entirely.
Narration/&Council02_Final8_Any_Default	Text	And it may not be totally safe.
Narration/&Council02_Final9_Any_Default	Text	Scavengers are going to establish an outpost, I suppose.
Narration/&Council02_Final10_Gormdsottir_NPC	Text	This is an incredible finding, deputies. Thanks for your service.
Narration/&Council02_Final11_Any_Default	Text	You're welcome.
Narration/&Council02_Final12_Any_Formal	Text	Chancellor.
Narration/&Exposition1_Beric_NPC	Text	Four new members, all recommended by trusted citizens.
Narration/&Exposition2_Gormsdottir_NPC	Text	We should deputize them right away.
Narration/&Exposition3_Beric_NPC	Text	They will be pretty green. Let's wait for Captain Merran to return.
Narration/&Exposition4_Gormsdottir_NPC	Text	We can't wait. Three weeks without any news?
Narration/&Exposition5_Gormsdottir_NPC	Text	Everybody in Caer Lem might be dead already.
Narration/&Exposition6_Gormsdottir_NPC	Text	Lord Stonebeard is eager to send troops to rescue his daughter.
Narration/&Exposition7_Beric_NPC	Text	Only Council forces may enter the Badlands! Otherwise, the treaty is broken, and it's war.
Narration/&Exposition8_Gormsdottir_NPC	Text	That's why we need to hire more Council deputies, even if they're not tested!
Narration/&Exposition9_Gormsdottir_NPC	Text	Way too many people are waiting for the Council to fail!
Narration/&Exposition10_Gormsdottir_NPC	Text	Oh, look, the Legacy Council doesn't work! Nobody wants to join it!
Narration/&Exposition11_Gormsdottir_NPC	Text	Let's invade the principality and take the Badlands' treasures first!
Narration/&Exposition12_Beric_NPC	Text	I know. The Council must hold.
Narration/&Exposition13_Beric_NPC	Text	Let's get our new deputies to work.
Narration/&CarranTalk_1_Carran_NPC	Text	Lord Carran, we'd like to ask you a few questions.
Narration/&CarranTalk_2_Player_Default	Text	Again?
Narration/&CarranTalk_3_Carran_NPC	Text	Well, I'm here at your service, deputies.
Narration/&CarranTalk_4_WRITTEN_A	Text	Ask for details about the geography.
Narration/&CarranTalk_5_WRITTEN_A1	Text	Ask for details about the Principality.
Narration/&CarranTalk_6_WRITTEN_A2	Text	Ask for details about the Badlands.
Narration/&CarranTalk_7_WRITTEN_A3	Text	Ask for details about the Eastern Kingdoms.
Narration/&CarranTalk_8_WRITTEN_B	Text	Ask for details about the politics.
Narration/&CarranTalk_9_WRITTEN_B1	Text	Ask for details about the Council.
Narration/&CarranTalk_10_WRITTEN_B2	Text	Ask for details about the factions.
Narration/&CarranTalk_11_WRITTEN_B3	Text	Ask for details about the Scavengers.
Narration/&CarranTalk_12_WRITTEN_ChangeTopics	Text	Change the general topic.
Narration/&CarranTalk_13_Player_Default	Text	Can you explain again the Legacy Council's purpose?
Narration/&CarranTalk_14_Carran_NPC	Text	Really? Right.
Narration/&CarranTalk_15_Carran_NPC	Text	The Council was founded to ease tensions among the Eastern Kingdoms.
Narration/&CarranTalk_16_Carran_NPC	Text	The position of the Copperhead Road puts the Principality in a strategic position…
Narration/&CarranTalk_17_Carran_NPC	Text	…to exploit the ancient knowledge and treasures that come out of the Badlands.
Narration/&CarranTalk_18_Carran_NPC	Text	The Council makes sure everyone has equal access, so no one's tempted to invade.
Narration/&CarranTalk_19_Player_Default	Text	Why are you recruiting adventurers?
Narration/&CarranTalk_20_Carran_NPC	Text	To scout the Badlands and the Marches that surround them…
Narration/&CarranTalk_21_Carran_NPC	Text	…and bring back whatever can be recovered. Antiquities, magical lore, anything.
Narration/&CarranTalk_22_Carran_NPC	Text	Then the Council makes sure everyone gets a chance to study it.
Narration/&CarranTalk_23_Carran_NPC	Text	We want people who will swear allegiance to the Council, and not to one nation.
Narration/&CarranTalk_24_Carran_NPC	Text	It's a… fresh idea. I'm afraid it hasn't had much success so far.
Narration/&CarranTalk_25_Carran_NPC	Text	Captain Merran is a great example for beginners.
Narration/&CarranTalk_26_Carran_NPC	Text	But the events in Caer Lem… well, we lost almost all of our people there.
Narration/&CarranTalk_27_Carran_NPC	Text	Captain Henrik's demise sends the wrong message.
Narration/&CarranTalk_28_Carran_NPC	Text	Lord Stonebeard, an influential member of the Snow Alliance is also very…
Narration/&CarranTalk_29_Carran_NPC	Text	…doubtful about the whole concept.
Narration/&CarranTalk_30_Carran_NPC	Text	I thought you knew, since you're in it…
Narration/&CarranTalk_31_Player_Default	Text	What can you tell us about the Scavengers?
Narration/&CarranTalk_32_Carran_NPC	Text	I would say: don't be fooled by the name.
Narration/&CarranTalk_33_Carran_NPC	Text	Some of them were already exploring the Old Empire before the Copperhead Road…
Narration/&CarranTalk_34_Carran_NPC	Text	…when it was near impossible to get through the mountains and into the Badlands.
Narration/&CarranTalk_35_Carran_NPC	Text	Most of them are now providing services to adventurers, and the Council.
Narration/&CarranTalk_36_Carran_NPC	Text	I supposed you've already met Annie Bagmordah, her leader.
Narration/&CarranTalk_37_Carran_NPC	Text	What factions are in play here?
Narration/&CarranTalk_38_Carran_NPC	Text	The Circle of Danantar is based here in the Principality.
Narration/&CarranTalk_39_Carran_NPC	Text	His leader, Lord Edvan Danantar, is a renowned Spellblade master.
Narration/&CarranTalk_40_Carran_NPC	Text	The Guild of Antiquarians is from the Snow Alliance, to the north.
Narration/&CarranTalk_41_Carran_NPC	Text	They crave anything of historical value, even mundane items…
Narration/&CarranTalk_42_Carran_NPC	Text	…as long as they're old enough.
Narration/&CarranTalk_43_Carran_NPC	Text	The Tower of Knowledge is from the Kingdom of Gallivan…
Narration/&CarranTalk_44_Carran_NPC	Text	…they are academics, interested in all kinds of… well, knowledge.
Narration/&CarranTalk_45_Carran_NPC	Text	The Arcaneum is from the New Empire…
Narration/&CarranTalk_46_Carran_NPC	Text	…magic is their passion, especially ancient, Manacalon magic.
Narration/&CarranTalk_47_Carran_NPC	Text	You're welcome, deputies.
Narration/&CarranTalk_48_Carran_NPC	Text	And… stay in the light.
Narration/&CarranTalk_49_Carran_NPC	Text	I'll be here to answer your questions…
Narration/&CarranTalk_50_Carran_NPC	Text	…unless I'm busy with Council affairs.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_01	Text	Where are we landing this time? 
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_02	Text	The lake shouldn't be dried up with such a flow coming from the river.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_02	Text	What do you think? Fight or leave?
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_2_Self_PreservationOrSelfishness_Normal	Text	You had to touch it!
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_3_Self_PreservationOrSelfishness_Normal	Text	Find us a way back! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_9b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	Text	…magic came out of nowhere! Targeting us! 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_10b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	Text	And how is that a curse? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_12b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default	Text	Who said what? 
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_13b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	Text	The voice! It said we would all die!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_14b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC	Text	After each death, it… it said it again!
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default	Text	Freeze, Soraks! 
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_2_Sellsword_Slang	Text	Time to show them who we are! 
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_3_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default	Text	They haven't seen us yet! No need to rush!
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_4_Sellsword_Slang	Text	It comes to the same thing in the end!
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_5_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default	Text	Look - they've gone into that shed! 
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_6_SpyOrHighestperception_Default	Text	It's pretty small for so many Soraks. Tunnel entrance?
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_8_NotHighestInt_Default	Text	No reason to wait, they're gone.
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_9_HighestWisorElse_Default	Text	What if they come out?
Narration/&Conjuration_GardenShed_8_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default	Text	We'll kill them.
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight1_Starter_Default	Text	What just happened?!
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight2_Cynical_Default	Text	A gem…right?
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight3_Cynical_Default	Text	Just like that.
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight4_Selfpres_Default	Text	Did you hear that? 
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight5_Sellsword_Default	Text	The sound of killing.
Narration/&Conjuration_SorakFight6_Starter_Default	Text	The soraks.
